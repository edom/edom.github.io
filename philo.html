<h3 id="target-audience-purpose-and-how-to-read"><span class="section_number">1.1</span><span class="section_title">Target audience, purpose, and how to read</span></h3>
<p>The target audience of this book is myself.</p>
<p>Purpose of the book: To find the ultimate consequences of mind-related concepts defined in English. My plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Define</em> the concepts according to how we use them in everyday English.</li>
<li><em>Infer</em> the consequences of those definitions.</li>
<li><em>Relate</em> the concepts with each other.</li>
<li><em>Order</em> the concepts by requirement (which concepts require which concepts).</li>
</ul>
<p>How to read this book: Read anything you want to. But most parts are unfinished. If you feel that a part is unfinished, feel free to skip it.</p>
<p>Perhaps this book should be like formal concept analysis<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>?</p>
<h3 id="fundamental-assumptions"><span class="section_number">1.2</span><span class="section_title">Fundamental assumptions</span></h3>
<p><em>We must agree on these before you read further.</em> If we don't agree, no communication can happen between us. I'm not absolutely certain about these assumptions. I'm happy to change my beliefs if there is a reason for that. But I don't know how I can communicate without them.</p>
<p><em>I assume these axioms.</em></p>
<p>Objective reality exists.</p>
<p>Logic works.</p>
<p>Every statement has exactly one truth value (somewhere in the continuum between false and true), although we may not always know it.</p>
<p><em>I assume that these concepts are primitive concepts.</em> I leave them undefined. They are like the concept of &quot;point&quot; in geometry. I don't know how to state them in terms of anything simpler. The primitives are: want, to want, belief, to believe.</p>
<p><em>I assume these synonyms.</em></p>
<p>imagination, fantasy. Imagination comes from Latin. Fantasy comes from Greek. Imagination and fantasy have the same meaning. Imagination doesn't have to be visual, although &quot;imagination&quot; and &quot;image&quot; are related.</p>
<p>knowledge, awareness. These are the same: to <em>know</em> X, to be <em>aware</em> of X.</p>
<p>attention, focus.</p>
<h3 id="the-concept-graphclusters"><span class="section_number">1.3</span><span class="section_title">The concept graph/clusters</span></h3>
<p>How to read this graph. Adjacency list. A paragraph beginning with the sentence &quot;A: B1, B2, …, Bn.&quot; declares n edges: A-B1, A-B2, and so on until A-Bn.</p>
<p>want (verb).</p>
<p>cause (verb). Synonyms: force, make.</p>
<p>control: force, want. X controls Y iff X can force Y to do what X wants.</p>
<p>self: control. X's self is the extent of X's control.</p>

<p>We should clarify words. We may generalize words, but we should not redefine words. We should start from their everyday meaning.</p>
<p>We should avoid inventing a new word if a word already exists for it.</p>
<p>We should use everyday language. People who bend words too much alienate themselves.</p>
<p>Most debates are definition problems. Communication requires that everyone use the same definitions.</p>

<p>&lt;2018-11-06&gt;</p>
<p>Ability is the existence of satisfying action.</p>
<p>&quot;S can P&quot; means &quot;There exists an action A such that, after S does A, the statement 'S did P' becomes true.&quot; Example: &quot;I can boil an egg&quot; means &quot;There is something I can do to make the statement 'I did boil an egg' true&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;S cannot P&quot; means &quot;It is false that S can P&quot;. Thus it means &quot;there is <em>nothing</em> S can do to make 'S did P' true.&quot;</p>
<p>Problem: &quot;cannot&quot; is hard to prove, if it's even possible to prove at all. Example: There are several issues with &quot;I can't jump 10 meters high&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I not able to do that, or do I merely not know how to do that? There is a difference between <em>not being able</em> and <em>not knowing how</em>.</li>
<li>Linguistic issue: What does &quot;jump&quot; mean? Must I use my own legs?</li>
<li>Proving a universal negative: How do I know that there is <em>nothing</em> I can do to make &quot;I jumped 10 meters high&quot; true?</li>
</ul>
<p>People sometimes say &quot;can't&quot; when they mean &quot;won't&quot;. Example: &quot;I can't wake up earlier.&quot; Of course he <em>can</em>; there is a satisfying action: Go to bed earlier, and put the goddamn phone away from bed. But he doesn't <em>want</em> to. He should say &quot;I don't want to wake up earlier.&quot; But <em>can</em> doesn't mean <em>should</em>.</p>
<p>People sometimes say &quot;can't&quot; when they mean they don't know how. Example: &quot;I can't start the car.&quot; Of course he <em>can</em>; there is a satisfying action: Repair the car, turn the key, and so on. But he doesn't <em>know</em> how.

<p>We assume that &quot;want&quot; is a primitive concept.</p>
<p>We assume that everything wants something.</p>
<h3 id="to-be-animate-is-to-have-changing-wants"><span class="section_number">4.2</span><span class="section_title">To be animate is to have changing wants</span></h3>
<p>&lt;2018-11-07&gt;</p>
<p>To be <em>animate</em> is to have changing wants.</p>
<p>To be <em>inanimate</em> is to have unchanging wants. An <em>inanimate</em> thing is a thing whose wants don't change. That inanimate thing always has that same want.</p>
<p>An <em>animate</em> thing is a thing whose want may change.</p>
<p>Problem: Must the wants change? Or is it sufficient to have the <em>possibility</em> of changing wants, without having to <em>actually</em> ever change wants? What is the difference between: one who can do X but never does X, and one who really cannot do X?</p>
<h3 id="life-is-a-thing-that-has-changing-wants"><span class="section_number">4.3</span><span class="section_title">Life is a thing that has changing wants</span></h3>
<p>Synonym: An <em>animate</em> thing is a <em>living</em> thing. A living thing <em>lives</em>. Thus the meaning of &quot;to live&quot; is &quot;to have changing wants&quot;. Thus the meaning of &quot;life&quot; is, literally, &quot;a thing that has changing wants&quot;.</p>
<p>Problem: this definition generalizes &quot;to live&quot; too much?</p>
<h3 id="science-is-about-finding-what-each-inanimate-thing-wants"><span class="section_number">4.4</span><span class="section_title">Science is about finding what each inanimate thing wants</span></h3>
<p>Recall that, by definition, each inanimate thing has an <em>unchanging</em> want. One way of finding those wants is the hypothetico-deductive scientific method.</p>
<p>Remember that we assume that <em>want</em> is a primitive concept. It doesn't assume what can want and what can't want.</p>
<p>What an <em>inanimate</em> thing <em>wants</em> is what it would do if it weren't <em>forced</em> to. Thus we can find what an inanimate thing want by <em>isolating</em> it so that nothing forces it to do anything.</p>
<p>Example. Imagine a weight balance. I put a heavier weight on the left plate. I put a lighter weight on the right plate. Both weights <em>want</em> to fall toward the Earth. The heavier weight <em>forces</em> the lighter weight to rise, against what the lighter weight <em>wants</em>, against what the lighter weight would do if the heavier weight did not force the lighter weight to rise.</p>
<p><em>Science aims to find what each inanimate thing wants.</em> We isolate inanimate things, so that nothing control them, so that we know how they behave. We isolate atoms so that we can understand their wants.</p>
<p>Nature <em>wants</em> to enforce the law of nature.</p>
<p>A gas <em>wants</em> to fill its container?</p>
<p>We aren't personifying inanimate things. They do <em>want</em> something. It's just that their wants don't change with time.</p>
<p>Every mass <em>wants</em> to attract every other mass. Earth <em>wants</em> a rock to fall toward the Earth.</p>
<p>What does a voltage regulator want?</p>
<p>There is a difference between these statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every thing that does not exist wants to continue not-existing.</li>
<li>Nothing wants to continue not-existing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-how-do-we-know-that-nothing-is-forcing-an-inanimate-thing-to-do-anything"><span class="section_number">4.5</span><span class="section_title">Problem: How do we know that nothing is forcing an inanimate thing to do anything?</span></h3>
<p>Difference of meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Nothing&quot; exists = the English word &quot;nothing&quot; exists</li>
<li>Nothing exists = there does not exist anything; it is not true that anything exists</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one does &quot;Nothing causes its own existence&quot; mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>There isn't anything that causes its own existence.</li>
<li>There is a thing that we call &quot;nothing&quot;, and it causes its own existence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can something cause its own existence? Can something causes itself to exist? Is there such a thing?</p>
<p>Is there something forcing everything else to exist?</p>
<p>Is everything forced to exist? Does anything want to exist?</p>
<p>If we assume that something cannot cause its own existence, then everything must have a cause that is not itself. Thus there is something <em>forcing</em> everything else to <em>exist</em>.</p>
<p>If I don't exist, how can I force myself to exist?</p>

<p>What does this mean: &quot;C gives us some information about E&quot;?</p>

<p>Let C abbreviate Cause.</p>
<p>Let E abbreviate Effect.</p>
<p>&quot;C and E correlate&quot; means that &quot;E happens if C happens, and E doesn't happen if C doesn't happen&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Immediate&quot; means &quot;within short duration&quot;.</p>
<p>If we often see C happen <em>immediately before</em> E, and we often see C and E <em>correlate</em>, then we may come to <em>believe</em> that C <em>causes</em> E. To justify this, we tacitly assume that <em>not much</em> can happen in such short duration; we assume that the <em>immediate future</em> is predictable. We assume the short duration between C and E makes it improbable for anything else to <em>confound</em> the way C causes E. The shorter the duration, the more improbable confounding is.</p>
<p>Consider two drugs: S (Slow) and F (Fast). Suppose that, in reality, F makes the person vomit after 1 hour, and S makes the person vomit after 1 year, but we don't know those yet. It is easier for us to see (and conclude) that F causes vomiting than to see that S causes vomiting, because there are much fewer things that can make the person vomit in 1 hour than in 1 year.</p>
<p>Thus we may define <em>duration</em> as <em>maximum number of possible events</em>. There are more things that may happen in 2 seconds than in 1 second. What does it mean for something to <em>happen</em>?</p>
<p>We may <em>believe</em> that C causes E, but does C <em>really</em> cause E?</p>
<p>I strike a match head. Then it ignites.</p>
<p>I do that three times with other match heads, and find the same thing.</p>
<p>Thus I generalize: Striking a match head <em>causes</em> its ignition.</p>
<p>Modern physics can explicate the <em>chain</em> of causes (I may mistake the details). Friction <em>causes</em> the the heating of the stricken part of the match head. The heat and oxygen <em>causes</em> the ignition of the stricken part. The ignition <em>causes</em> more conversion of chemical bonds into heat. The additional heat <em>causes</em> a chain reaction that spreads the flame into nearby unlit parts.</p>
<p>I wet a match head with drinking water. I strike it. It doesn't ignite. I infer that the wetness causes the match head to fail to ignite. What justifies my inference?</p>

<p>X <em>controls</em> Y iff X <em>forces</em> (causes) Y to do what X <em>wants</em> Y to do.</p>
<p>Remember that &quot;to force&quot; means &quot;to cause&quot;.</p>
<p>Remember that we assume that <em>want</em> is a primitive concept. It doesn't assume what can want and what can't want.</p>
<p>We assume that causation is transitive.</p>
<p>Control is transitive, because causation is transitive. If X controls Y, and Y controls Z, then X controls Z. The contraposition: If X doesn't control Z, then: X doesn't control Y, or Y doesn't control Z, or both.</p>
<p>We can use that contraposition to find who controls whom in a company. Example. Alice, Bob, and Charlie are in the same company. In the hierarchy, Alice commands Bob, and Bob commands Charlie. Alice knows Charlie, but never interacts with Charlie. If Alice tells Bob to make Charlie do what Alice wants Charlie to do, but Charlie doesn't do it, then there are three possibilities: Alice doesn't control Bob, or Bob doesn't control Charlie, or both.</p>

<p>The self of X is the <em>set</em> of everything that X controls. Therefore, because selves are sets, they can intersect and join. This is an ordinary set theory in mathematics.</p>
<p>If there is an overlap between what A controls and what B controls, then they <em>share</em> that overlapping part of their selves. That overlapping part is a <em>joint</em> self.</p>
<p>The size of self may vary over time.</p>
<p>Selves may <em>merge</em> and <em>split</em>. When I'm using a computer, some of the computer's self and some of my self <em>merge</em> into a bigger self. When I'm not using the computer, our selves <em>split</em>.</p>
<p>If I sever my hand, then that hand ceases to be a part of my self, because I can no longer control it.

<li>&quot;The self is an individual person as the object of his or her own reflective consciousness. This reference is necessarily subjective, thus self is a reference by a subject to the same subject. The sense of having a self – or self-hood – should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The first-person perspective distinguishes self-hood from personal identity. Whereas &quot;identity&quot; is sameness, self-hood implies a first-person perspective.&quot;</li>

<p>To &quot;control&quot; something is to have &quot;causal authority&quot; over it.</p>

<p>&quot;Causal authority&quot; sounds cool. But what does it mean?</p>
<h3 id="tools-usage-enlargement-of-self-boundary-of-control"><span class="section_number">6.4</span><span class="section_title">Tools, usage, enlargement of self (boundary of control)</span></h3>
<p>Remember that we defined <em>self</em> as everything that we control.</p>
<p>The essence of tools is the enlargement of self (the boundary of control).</p>
<p>A <em>tool</em> is a thing that extends our <em>self</em> (our boundary of control). A tool is a thing that enables us to control more things than we would without that tool.</p>
<p>&quot;Tool&quot; is a relative concept, like &quot;weed&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;. Whether something is a tool depends on what use we imagine of it. We can think of a rock as a useless heavy space-occupying thing. We can think of a rock as a tool for crushing things. To 20th century people, a computer is a mind extension tool. To a villager in the Stone Age, a computer might be a heavy weight that can be thrown to kill animals.</p>
<p><em>Usage is goal-directed control</em>. To use something is to control it for a goal/purpose/intention. &quot;To use X for Y&quot; is to control X in order to achieve Y (to make Y true).</p>
<p>A tool is something we use.</p>
<p>A tool may be animate.</p>
<p>People are tools. Everyone uses everyone else. We use each other. A worker is a capitalist's tool; a capitalist is also a worker's tool. An employee is his employer's tool; an employer is also his employee's tool. Surely employers avoid hiring useless employees, and employees avoid hiring useless employers. A useless employee doesn't work; a useless employer doesn't pay.</p>
<p>How <em>do</em> we use this person? How <em>can</em> we use this person? What <em>does</em> this person help us do? What <em>can</em> this person help us do?</p>
<p>Using other people is not inherently bad. One can use his tools with care, whether animate and inanimate. But this idea may discomfort non-philosophers.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before a tool-using animal realizes that it can use other animals as tools.</p>
<p>Are we using others, or are we being used by others?</p>

<p>We don't know what &quot;knowledge&quot; is. But, for this section, assume that we know.</p>
<p>We think we can share or transfer some knowledge.</p>
<p>We can <em>transfer</em> some knowledge by <em>simulation</em>. Simulator-trained pilots <em>know</em> how to fly planes: If they can fly the planes in the simulator, they can fly the planes in reality.</p>
<p>We can <em>transfer</em> some knowledge by <em>teaching</em>. School teachers <em>transfer</em> knowledge to their students.</p>
<p>Language enables some knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>We don't know how to transfer other knowledge. The taste of salt. The hue of green.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday technology will enable transferring all knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-software-copy-and-move"><span class="section_number">7.2</span><span class="section_title">Knowledge, software, copy, and move</span></h3>
<p>We can <em>copy</em> knowledge, but not <em>move</em> knowledge. This is similar to software: it can be copied but not moved. By move I mean: when you move your car from place A to place B, the car is now at B, and is no longer at A. But we don't <em>move</em> software from hardware A to hardware B; we <em>copy</em> it from A to B, and then <em>delete</em> the copy at A. The same with knowledge: We don't move it from person A to person B; we <em>copy</em> it; we spread it; and we don't know how to <em>delete</em> knowledge from a person.</p>
<p>Books are not knowledge. Books contain <em>text</em>, not knowledge. Destroying a book is like destroying a computer disk that contains a program.</p>
<h3 id="old-english-ken-wit-and-knowledge"><span class="section_number">7.3</span><span class="section_title">Old English, ken, wit, and knowledge</span></h3>

<p>&lt;2018-11-04&gt;</p>
<p><em>Consciousness</em> is the ability to know.</p>
<p>Something is <em>conscious</em> iff it <em>can know</em>.</p>
<p>While I'm sleeping, I'm <em>unconscious</em> (I have <em>low consciousness</em>), because I can only know very little while I'm sleeping.</p>
<p>I have <em>more consciousness</em> when I'm awake than when I'm asleep, because I <em>can know more</em> when I'm awake than when I'm asleep.</p>
<p>Why are we so sure that a rock doesn't know anything?</p>
<p>On the etymology of the word &quot;conscious&quot;, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conscious">Wiktionary</a> says that it comes from Latin &quot;con-&quot; (together) and &quot;scire&quot; (to know).</p>

<p>Defining consciousness as &quot;the ability to know&quot; raises two questions: What does it mean to <em>know</em> something? What does it mean to be <em>able</em> to do something?</p>
<p>&quot;What does it mean to know something&quot; is the question that epistemology aims to answer.</p>
<p>Thus defining consciousness requires epistemology.</p>

<li>If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment. The self concept will never arise.</li>
<li>If a brain can immediately control a thing, then that thing is part of the brain's self concept. If the brain can't, it's not.</li>

<p>Remember that the <em>material conditional</em> <span class="math inline">\( p \to q \)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\( \neg (p \wedge \neg q) \)</span> in classical logic.</p>
<p>We can interpret <span class="math inline">\( p \wedge \neg q \)</span> as &quot;<span class="math inline">\( p \)</span> <em>precludes</em> <span class="math inline">\( q \)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Thus we can interpret the material conditional <span class="math inline">\( p \to q \)</span> as &quot;<span class="math inline">\( p \)</span> <em>does not preclude</em> <span class="math inline">\( q \)</span>&quot;. However, we practically pretend that it means &quot;if <span class="math inline">\( p \)</span> then <span class="math inline">\( q \)</span>&quot;. This lie works because we practically always pick relevant <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, there is a difficulty: If <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are irrelevant, <span class="math inline">\( p \)</span> is true, and <span class="math inline">\( q \)</span> is false, then what does &quot;<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> does not preclude <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>&quot; mean?</p>

<p>A number exists ideally. It doesn't exist physically. Our body can't interact with a number. We can't touch a real number. There is no physical experiment that tests the properties of numbers. Our mind can't interact with a number either. We can't imagine a number. We can only imagine a <em>representation</em> of that number.</p>
<p>But our minds can correlate idea space and physical space.</p>
<p>We use physics experiments to find out physical laws. We use thought experiments to find out ideal laws (such as theorems about real numbers). An eye is a physical sense that enables the brain to probe the space of bodies. A mind is an ideal sense that enables the brain to probe the space of ideas.</p>

<p>(I need to find the words to say this, and rewrite this more clearly.)</p>
<p>A <em>machine</em> is an <em>automatic tool</em>: it is a tool that runs by itself; it has its own behavior.</p>
<p>A hammer doesn't have its own behaviors. A car has its own behaviors. A computer has its own behaviors.</p>

<p>Computation is approximate expression normalization. To <em>compute</em> a real number is to calculate some of its digits. To <em>compute</em> an arithmetic <em>expression</em> is to <em>evaluate</em> it (to reduce it into a <em>value</em>), often approximately. For example: 1/7 is an <em>expression</em>, and .142 is a <em>value</em> that is the 3 most significant digits of the result of <em>evaluating</em> that expression.</p>
<p>Why do we feel that 1.412 is <em>more evaluated</em> than <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>? Why do we feel that 1.412 is a <em>normal form</em>? Because it is <em>physically easier</em> for us to locate 1.412 on the real number line than to locate <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>. Thus to compute a real number is to <em>locate it</em> on the real number line. This justifies the geometric interpretation of real numbers.</p>
<p>We can <em>partially evaluate</em> an expression, such as from 1+2-1 to 3-1.</p>

<p>Don't conflate a <em>real-number expression</em> and a <em>real number</em>. A real-number expression <em>evaluates</em> to a real number. A real-number expression <em>is not</em> a real number.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f:E(\Real)\to\Real\)</span> be the evaluation function.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the machine computing when I'm typing this document?</li>
<li>There are several ways of defining the real numbers. Which one should we use for the philosophy of mind and computation, and why?</li>
</ul>
<p>Algebraic-geometric definition: A <em>real number</em> is a <em>point</em> in the <em>totally-ordered</em> set of points in <em>one-dimensional</em> Euclidean geometry; the real numbers form a <em>field</em>.</p>
<p>Addition also has a geometric meaning: it is the set of points on the plane <span class="math inline">\(\{(x,y,z) ~\vert~ x+y=z\}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="algorithm-machine-describability-computability"><span class="section_number">10.3</span><span class="section_title">Algorithm, machine, describability, computability</span></h3>
<p>We assume that these are primitive concepts: algorithm, machine. By &quot;machine&quot;, we mean a computing machine.</p>
<p>An algorithm <em>describes</em> what a machine <em>computes</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>algorithm</em> is an <em>executable description</em>: a string in a formal language in a formal system. A description has <em>finite</em> length. By &quot;executable&quot;, we mean that an algorithm has a <em>machine model</em>. We always define an algorithm with respect to a machine.</p>
<p>Thus not every real number is <em>describable</em>, because there are fewer strings in that formal language than there are real numbers.</p>
<p>Thus not every real number is <em>computable</em>, because computability requires describability.</p>
<p>Remember that a <em>formal system</em> is a <em>formal language</em> and a set of <em>inference rules</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/42443/relationship-between-formal-system-and-formal-languages">https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/42443/relationship-between-formal-system-and-formal-languages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An algorithm is a string in a formal language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. We <em>model</em> a <em>machine</em> as a <em>formal system</em> whose language is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. The machine is not the formal system. The thing is not the model.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for a machine to <em>compute</em> a real number?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(Y(T) \in \Real\)</span> is the <em>output</em> of the algorithm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> if we let the algorithm run for duration <span class="math inline">\(T \in \Nat\)</span>.</p>
<p>The algorithm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> <em>computes</em> the <em>limit</em> of the approximation sequence <span class="math inline">\( \langle Y(t) \rangle_{t \in \Nat} \)</span>. Thus &quot;<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> computes real number <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>&quot; means that the limit of that sequence is <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>More explicitly, we say &quot;the algorithm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> <em>computes</em> the real number <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>&quot; to mean: for every approximation error <span class="math inline">\(E &gt; 0\)</span> that we are willing to have, there exists a duration <span class="math inline">\(T \in \Nat\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\abs{Y(T) - R} &lt; E\)</span>. Informally, the algorithm can always take more time to satisfy ever-diminishing (but still positive) approximation error.</p>
<p>A real number <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <em>computable</em> iff there is an algorithm that computes <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are as many natural numbers as there are algorithms. Therefore <em>not every real number is computable</em>, because there are fewer natural numbers than real numbers.</p>

<p>(This section needs rereading and rewriting.)</p>
<p>We read the sentence <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> as &quot;<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>'' or&quot;if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>''.</p>
<p>What does <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> mean?</p>
<p>It means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then we can infer <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</li>
<li>If we don't know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then the implication does not say anything at all.</li>
<li>Knowing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> allows us to <em>predict</em> <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</li>

<p>We can formalize this constraint by using a <em>metric</em> <span class="math inline">\(d : [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(u : [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]\)</span>. We can formalize the constraint as the following inequality:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    d(\tau(p), \tau(q)) \le u(\tau(p), \tau(p \to q))
\end{align}
\]</span>
<p>where the function <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> must satisfy <span class="math inline">\(u(0,x) = u(x,0) = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in [0,1]\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(u(1,1) = 0\)</span>. The right-hand side of the inequality says that the maximum distance depends only on <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span>.

<p>If both <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> are high, then the constraint is quite strict, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> should be near <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>modus ponens</em> is &quot;if we are sure about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and we are sure about <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span>, then we can be sure about <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>''. We can say that more formally as &quot;if <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> is high, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> is high, then <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> should be high''.</p>
<p>The number <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> should describe how <em>strictly</em> <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> constrains <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span>.

<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> is not constrained. (If we aren't sure about the premise, we can't make a conclusion, regardless of how sure we are about the implication.)</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q) = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> is not constrained. (If we aren't sure about the implication, we can't make a conclusion, regardless of how sure we are about the premise.)</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q) = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> has no freedom at all, and it must be <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q) = \tau(p) = 1\)</span>. (If we are sure about both the premise and the implication, then we can make the conclusion.)</li>
<li>If we know that <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> is low or <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> is low, then knowing any of those does not enable us to infer anything about <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span>.</li>

Indeed, for every real <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 0\)</span>, the definitions <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = 1 - (xy)^k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = (1 - xy)^k\)</span> satisfy those constraints. For simplicity, until there is reason for doing otherwise, we pick <span class="math inline">\(d(x,y) = |x - y|\)</span> (norm-1) and <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = 1 - xy\)</span>, and therefore we obtain the following special case:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    | \tau(p) - \tau(q) | \le 1 - \tau(p) \cdot \tau(p \to q).
\end{align}
\]</span>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(P = \tau(p)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q = \tau(q)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R = \tau(p \to q)\)</span>.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    (P-Q)^2 &amp;\le 1 - PR
    \\ (P-Q)^2-1 &amp;\le - PR
    \\ (P-Q+1)(P-Q-1) &amp;\le - PR
    \\ PR &amp;\le (P-Q+1)(P-Q-1)

    \\ R &amp;\le \left(1 - \frac{Q-1}{P}\right) \left( 1 - \frac{Q+1}{P}\right)
\end{align}
\]</span>
<p>Another example is <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = 1 - \min(x,y)\)</span>. Can it be written <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = \neg (x \wedge y)\)</span>, as in fuzzy logic?</p>
<p>If we know <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span>, but we don't know <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span>, then we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> as the midpoint. Let <span class="math inline">\(P = \tau(p)\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(Q = \tau(q)\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(R = \tau(p \to q)\)</span>.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}

<p>WTF…</p>
<p>(RAMBLE)</p>
<p>In classical logic, knowing <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span> allows us to determine <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span>. <em>This does not make sense.</em> It should be the other way around: knowing <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> should allow us to use <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> to restrict <span class="math inline">\(\tau(q)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We may know something for sure because we defined it to be true or we experienced it ourselves through our senses.</p>
<p>In classical logic, <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p)\)</span> is either 0 or 1, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 0\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is false, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 1\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true.</p>

<p>\end{m:lem} In probability theory, conditional probability is <span class="math inline">\(P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(A \cap B)\)</span>, which can also be written <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) \cdot \tau(p \to q) = \tau(p \wedge q)\)</span>.

<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 1\)</span> means that all swans are white, then <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 0.99\)</span> should mean that almost all swans are white, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = 0\)</span> should mean that we don't have any particular belief about whether swans are white. Should <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p) = -1\)</span> mean that no swans are white?</p>
<p>There are eight combinations of antecedent, consequent, and implication:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>total nonsense</em> (UUU): If X had been born in a Muslim family, then X would be a Christian now.</li>
<li><em>counterfactual</em> (UUR): If X had been born in a Muslim family, then X would be a Muslim now.</li>

<li><em>irrelevant</em> (RRU): If John is a man, then Mary is a woman.</li>
<li><em>law</em> (RRR): reasonable antecedent, reasonable consequent, reasonable implication: Theorems in mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>An implication should become more reasonable as its antecedent becomes more reasonable? An implication should become more reasonable as its consequent becomes more reasonable?</p>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> takes a sentence (a belief) and gives a real number in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. The value <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> describes how justified we are when we infer <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> just by knowing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> causes <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, then removing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> should also remove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Formally, <span class="math inline">\((p \to q) \vdash (\neg p \to \neg q)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Correlation is a necessary but not sufficient for causation.</p>
<p>Finding common cause: Find <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p \to r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Should <span class="math inline">\(p \to \top\)</span> be equally true to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>?</p>
<p>Example: John pressed the button, and a light blinked. It is rational for John to reason that if the button were not pressed, the light would not blink. But why is that rational? What is the mathematical justification? The implicit belief that the system always behaves the same way. The implicit belief is that the button behaves the same at all times. <span class="math inline">\(\forall t \in \Real, press(t) \to blink(t + 1)\)</span></p>
<p>Every counterfactual reasoning implicitly makes a <em>ceteris paribus</em> (everything else being equal) assumption. When we make a counterfactual implication, we assume that everything else other than the premise stays the same in the past we are imagining. &quot;If the driver was driving more slowly, the driver would have had enough time to brake, and therefore the crash would have been avoided.&quot;</p>
<p>Suppose that two cars crashed at an intersection. What causes the crash?</p>
<p>If we have that axiom, then by <span class="math inline">\(\forall\)</span>-elimination we can prove the following, given <span class="math inline">\(t_0 \in \Real\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(press(t_0) \to blink(t_0 + 1)\)</span></p>
<p>What should <span class="math inline">\(\tau(p \to q)\)</span> be?</p>

<ul>
<li>This article makes me sure that I'm not interested in how to measure consciousness, I'm not interested in neural correlates of consciousness, and I'm not interested in neuroscience.</li>
<li>Consciousness research is multidisciplinary.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists agreed that the philosophical problems of why and how there is consciousness are also their problems. Philosophers agreed that empirical evidence may resolve or at least influence this debate. Scientists across disciplines generally agree that consciousness is subjective, characterized by a kind of privileged first-person access.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenges
<ul>
<li>&quot;One major obstacle for consciousness research is the lacking consensus of how to optimally measure consciousness empirically.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Another major challenge is how to identify neural correlates of consciousness.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;The future challenges&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;One major future challenge will be how to measure consciousness 'from the outside'.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;One possibly even greater challenge will be to reintegrate the philosophical metaphysical debate into the scientific work.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Future directions&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Currently, consciousness research is often considered a 'topic'—or even 'niche'—under the umbrella of cognitive neuroscience.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2011 article &quot;Understanding Brain, Mind and Soul: Contributions from Neurology and Neurosurgery&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115284/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115284/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The section &quot;The Mind&quot; correlates brain damage and behavior change.</li>
<li>The section &quot;Where is the Mind Located?&quot; says &quot;The brain is the organ of the mind just as the lungs are the organs for respiration.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How does the Mind Function?&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Krishnamoorthy (2009) uses an analogy based on computers to explain the workings of the mind: […]&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The mind cannot be localised to particular areas within the brain, […]&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;The Soul&quot;; &quot;The search and some conclusions&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;In 1907, Dr. Duncan MacDougall of Haverhill, Massachusetts, decided to weigh the soul by weighing a human being in the act of death.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If there be a soul, where is it located? Views of neuroscientists&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;If we accept the existence of the soul and its localisation in the brain, we must focus on the brainstem.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Take home message&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;The study of the brain, mind and soul has engaged some of the finest intellects of yesteryears. It remains an ennobling and inspiring pursuit, worthy of all those who are dedicated votaries of science.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Questions That This Paper Raises&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;2. Do you agree with the author’s conclusions on the mind in the brain?&quot;
<ul>
<li>My objections to the article
<ul>
<li>&lt;2018-11-04&gt; I doubt &quot;The brain is the organ of the mind […]&quot;; near-death experience research suggests that the mind can function without brain activity.</li>

<li>&quot;In coming years, neuroscience will answer questions we don't even yet know to ask. Sometimes, though, focus on the brain is misleading.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;modern brain imaging seems to indicate that it is Spinoza's concept of an integrated mind-body that is closer to reality.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;psychologist William James' great work on consciousness in the late 1800s is slowly regaining the pivotal position it deserves in understanding and interpreting human behavior.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;technological advances in brain imaging have given scientists a new range of tools to more accurately observe and measure the apparent causes and manifestations of consciousness.&quot;</li>

<li><p>2016 Pim van Lommel interview &quot;Continuity of non-local consciousness&quot; <a href="https://www.landelijkexpertisecentrumsterven.nl/inspiratie/continuity-of-non-local-consciousness/">https://www.landelijkexpertisecentrumsterven.nl/inspiratie/continuity-of-non-local-consciousness/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Which experiment of continuity of nonlocal consciousness convinces you the most?
<ul>
<li>&quot;the studies of near-death experience (NDE) in survivors of cardiac arrest&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Based on these NDE-studies one can conclude that there are good reasons to assume that our consciousness does not always coincide with the functioning of our brain&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;most likely the brain must have a facilitating and not a producing function to experience consciousness&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Also cases of after-death communication (ADC), with communication with the consciousness of deceased loved ones, and sometimes information was shared that was not yet known&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Like the NDE there is also a huge taboo to talk about ADCs, because they cannot be 'objectively proven'.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How did you contribute?
<ul>
<li>&quot;our prospective study in survivors of cardiac arrest&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;after the temporary loss of all functions of the brain during clinical death (= cardiac arrest) the experience of enhanced consciousness was still possible in 18% of those patients&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;How close do you feel we are in establishing without a doubt that there is life after death?&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;it will never be possible to 'prove' this idea because consciousness is subjective, and (materialist) science uses only objective methodology&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The scientific study of NDE pushes us to the limits of our medical and neurophysiological ideas about the range of human consciousness and mind-brain relation.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;there is no agreement among physicists on what nonlocality means&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Bohmian mechanics is different from traditional quantum mechanics, in that particles follow definite trajectories, and possess both a definite position and momentum. This doesn’t violate the uncertainty principle, because that principle only places limits to what we can know about position and momentum. What Bohm said is that a quantum particle has a real as opposed to statistical existence, […]&quot;</li>

<li>Lucien Hardy &quot;has an experiment to see if the mind operates on a quantum level.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am currently working with the group of Jian-Wei Pan to realize this experiment using their satellite source that can distribute entanglement over 1200km.&quot; <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/lucien-hardy">https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/lucien-hardy</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li>&quot;It’s a Bell test that Hardy is interested in running, with an added wrinkle of his own. Instead of varying the properties to be observed using random number generators, he proposes observing entangled particles with A and B detection units positioned 100 kilometers apart, and whose settings are controlled by EEG signals from headsets on 100 human volunteers.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;What is the evidence so far?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Currently consciousness is considered by mainstream science as an epiphenomenon often with no causal consequence that emerges from this structure in a sort of magical way. The prevailing view is that consciousness an illusion created by the brain.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;One of our main approach […] is to perform scientific experiments which attempt to show the non locality of consciousness.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If consciousness is non-local, then certainly the 'consciousness in the brain' hypothesis must be revised.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;The mind is a set of cognitive faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, language and memory.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind</a>
<ul>
<li>&quot;mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can 'do'.&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Memory is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Imagination is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, images, ideas or other qualia in the mind.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Philosophical theories of mental content include internalism, externalism, representationalism and intentionality.&quot;

<li>&quot;Descartes, who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in mechanistic terms, although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain matter and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with traumatic brain injury and psychoactive drug use.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include connectionism, computationalism and Bayesian brain.&quot;

<li>Philosophy of mind
<ul>
<li>&quot;One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Dualism and monism are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem.&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism</a></li>
<li>&quot;Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Monism is the position that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities.&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-aspect_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-aspect_theory</a>
<ul>
<li>&quot;[…] double-aspect theory is the view that the mental and the physical are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance. It is also called dual-aspect monism.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Physicalists argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism</a></li>
<li>&quot;Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive physicalist position&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the brain is all there is to the mind, the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Neutral monists adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver.&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;The mind–body problem is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&quot;</li>

<p>Example. A feedback system <em>controls</em> its output? I don't <em>control</em> what you say but I <em>control</em> my emotion. Who is <em>in control</em>? The situation is getting <em>out of control</em>? I <em>control</em> the character's motions using this <em>controller</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Control […] is a word with diverse meanings and applications, ranging from those found in control theory regarding dynamical systems, self-control of one's own behavior, social control of processes and political mechanisms that regulate individual and group behaviour, including security controls against perceived or unperceived dangers, mind control, in which groups or individuals systematically use unethically manipulative methods to direct others, and scientific control to isolate variables in experiments.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Control">https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Control</a></p>

<p>Control is making something go against what it would go when left alone.</p>
<p>Control is limit.</p>

<p>I wanted to read &quot;Book of why&quot;, but I changed my mind.</p>
<p>This book narrates Judea Pearl's hard-won war against anti-causality statisticians. Most of it is history of 21st century statistics. A little part describes causal model.</p>
<p>It's too long (400 pages). It should take at most 20 pages.</p>
<p>Is Pearl 2000 a better book?</p>
<p>Human interprets data.</p>
<p>Science requires philosophy.</p>
<p>To intervene is to control.</p>
<p>To control a variable is to fix its value.</p>
<p>How to read it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read page 111 about junctions: mediators, colliders, forks
<ul>
<li>page 113: &quot;We will now see that this collider pattern works in exactly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>the opposite way from chains or forks when we condition on the variable in the middle.&quot;</p>
<p>The collider is counterintuitive. What does it mean to control for an <em>output variable</em>?</p>
<p>There is no input/output variable in statistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read page 149 &quot;The do-operator and the back-door criterion&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;I like to think of the links as pipes that convey information from a starting point X to a finish Y.&quot;</p>

<p>Euclidean geometry locally models a manifold.</p>
<p>Non-Euclidean geometry removes an axiom from Euclidean geometry. Thus Euclidean-geometry models non-Euclidean geometry, by adding an axiom</p>
<p>The formula p to q models the formula q</p>
<p>The set of all theorems of a formal systema</p>
<p>A formal system F models a formal system G iff every theorem of F is also a theorem of G.</p>
<p>F has axioms A G has axioms A,B Same inference rules Thus every theorem in F is a theorem in G Is formal system inference rule monotonic? G is a model of F. The simplifying assumption is the extra axiom B. More axioms mean simpler formal system.</p>
<p>Elliptic geometry has fewer axioms than Euclidean geometry, and thus the former is objectively simpler than the latter, but why does the later <em>feels</em> simpler?</p>

<p>egoism: What benefits X is good for X. species egoism: What benefits X's species is good for X. nihilism: 'Good' doesn't exist. utilitarianism: What is good is what maximizes the sum of happiness of people. evolutionary: What is good is what we feel according to how we have evolved.</p>
<p>good, desirable, pain, masochist</p>
<p>X has power over Y iff X makes Y do what X want Y to do</p>
<p>Power and control is the same thing.</p>
<p>Agency; control; causality</p>
<h3 id="trolley-problem"><span class="section_number">17.2</span><span class="section_title">Trolley problem?</span></h3>
<p>My position on the original 1-vs-5 trolley problem: Never switch. If your existence does not make any difference, then you cannot be at fault. The objection &quot;But you could have saved 4 more people&quot; comes from misunderstanding causality.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you switch, you <em>cause</em> the death of 1 person, and you <em>cause</em> the survival of 5 people.</li>
<li>If you do nothing, you <em>can't cause</em> the death of 5 people, and you <em>can't cause</em> the survival of 1 people. If you do nothing, your existence does not make any difference, and you don't alter the natural course of events.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If your existence does not make any difference, then you cannot be at fault.</em> If the outcome does not depend on you, then you are not the cause of the outcome. Is it wrong to deliberately not use an ability?</p>
<p>The 1-vs-0 trolley problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two branches. 1 person on left branch. 0 people on right branch. Train is going to the left branch unless you switch the train. You know how many people on each branch.</li>
<li>If you switch, you cause the survival of 1 person.</li>
<li>If you don't switch, you don't cause the death of 1 person.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't know how many people are on each branch, should you switch?</p>
<p>Can we cause something that we don't know? Yes. Suppose you don't know that a bomb explodes when you kick it. You kick the bomb. It explodes. You caused the bomb to explode, although you did not intend to.</p>
<p>The trolley problem really asks these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can inaction cause anything, by definition?</li>
<li>Does it make sense for inaction to cause anything?</li>
<li>When should we change the course of natural events?</li>
</ul>
