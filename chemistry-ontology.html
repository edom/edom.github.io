<p>What is a mixture?</p>
<p>Mixing salt and water produces salt water, which can be separated by distillation, but mixing wood and oil of vitriol does not produce woody oil of vitriol.</p>
<p>When a homogenous mixture is divided into two equal parts, both parts have the same properties.</p>
<p>How did Democritus arrive at his idea, at such a long time before electrochemistry was discovered?</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus#Atomic_hypothesis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus#Atomic_hypothesis</a> &lt;2019-08-09&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Democritus, along with Leucippus and Epicurus, proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.[32] Using analogies from humans' sense experiences, he gave a picture or an image of an atom that distinguished them from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets.[33] The Democritean atom is an inert solid (merely excluding other bodies from its volume) that interacts with other atoms mechanically. In contrast, modern, quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric and magnetic force fields and are far from inert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, Lucretius, describing atomism in his De rerum natura, gives very clear and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate &quot;pure&quot; materials like water, air, and metals.[citation needed] The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: Why has everything in the world not yet decayed, and how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of &quot;atoms&quot;. These classical &quot;atoms&quot; are nearer to humans' modern concept of &quot;molecule&quot; than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these &quot;atoms&quot;: the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments[citation needed] that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material properties changing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the composition of water [that water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom] was not known before Avogadro (c. 1811).</p>
<p>In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica, which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli positioned the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.</p>
<p>Amedeo Avogadro created the word &quot;molecule&quot;.[8] His 1811 paper &quot;Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies&quot;, he essentially states, i.e. according to Partington's A Short History of Chemistry, that:[9] […]</p>
<p>Avogadro developed this hypothesis in order to reconcile Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac's 1808 law on volumes and combining gases with Dalton's 1803 atomic theory. The greatest difficulty Avogadro had to resolve was the huge confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules—one of the most important contributions of Avogadro's work was clearly distinguishing one from the other, admitting that simple particles too could be composed of molecules, and that these are composed of atoms. Dalton, by contrast, did not consider this possibility. Curiously, Avogadro considers only molecules containing even numbers of atoms; he does not say why odd numbers are left out.</p>
<p>The year 1873, by many accounts, was a seminal point in the history of the development of the concept of the &quot;molecule&quot;. In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of Nature.[15] In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states:</p>

<p>An atom is supposed to be an indivisible matter. But how do we know that it is really indivisible?</p>
<p>What are the properties of an atom? Indivisibility, supposedly.</p>
<p>How do we know that atoms exist? By dividing objects until we cannot. But what is the reason of our inability: Is it a limitation of our technology, or is it a limitation of Nature?</p>
<p>How do we infer that atoms exist?</p>
<p>We have it easy: School teachers shove atomic theory down our throat. Our ancestors had to figure it out the hard way: They have to hypothesize, experiment, fail, and even die, many times. We arrived at 21st century chemistry through a lot of experiments and reasoning. We don't see the toil of our ancestors, the thousands of hypotheses falsified by experiments.</p>
<p>How do we know atoms exist?<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Brownian motion? Dalton's ratios?<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>What is the details of Dalton's experiment? What gases did he use? What did he do?</p>
<p>Electron microscopes? But there was no such thing back then. How do we know atoms exist without electron microscopes?</p>
<p>Most knowledge about atoms is inferred, not directly perceived. Indeed knowledge about atoms is inferred abductively, not deductively.</p>
<p>It seems that we can only study minuscule things abductively and not deductively, because we lack the senses to perceive them directly.</p>

<p>At first, we defined &quot;atoms&quot; to be something unsplittable. Then, after several millenniums of research, we finally found some things that we could not split, so we named them &quot;atoms&quot;. Then, a few decades later, with improved instruments, we found that such atoms could indeed be split into electrons, protons, neutrons. Alas, in the meantime, hundreds of textbooks had been written, and the name had stuck. Thus, we redefined &quot;atom&quot; to mean a neutral bunch of protons, neutrons, and electrons, so that we did not have to rewrite all those textbooks. After all, words do not carry their meanings themselves; it is we who interpret words into meanings.</p>
