<h2 id="background"><span class="section_number">1</span><span class="section_title">Background</span></h2>
<p>&lt;2019-11-01&gt;</p>
<p>I was designing a programming language, and I encountered a problem: How should functions be grouped into source files?</p>
<p>The fact that functions must be in source files is a limitation of the implementation, not a requirement of mathematics.</p>
<p>Lambda calculus does not require that subexpressions be split into different source files.</p>
<h2 id="on-various-kinds-of-groupings"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">On various kinds of groupings</span></h2>
<p>What is the difference between these things: group, category, class, archetype, stereotype, bunch, herd, pack, school, flock, litter.</p>
<h2 id="grouping-and-trade-offs"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">Grouping and trade-offs</span></h2>
<p>Linnaean taxonomy helps us quickly find genetically close species, but it does not help us quickly find who eats who; the latter question is often asked in ecological engineering.</p>
<h2 id="should-we-group-functions"><span class="section_number">4</span><span class="section_title">Should we group functions?</span></h2>
<p>How do we group functions to simplify maintenance (understandability, modification, reverse engineering)? Things that change together go together.</p>
<p>How do we group functions to simplify writing code? Dump everything in one big file, and always write new code at the end of the file.</p>
<p>How do we group functions to simplify reading code?</p>
<p>They may produce different groupings.</p>
<p>Which one should we choose?</p>
<p><em>Do we even have to choose?</em> I think the computer should be able to regroup the functions for different purposes.</p>
<p>Can't we just write code in the way it is easiest to write, and let computers reorganize the code into another shape that is the easiest to read?</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-group-functions"><span class="section_number">5</span><span class="section_title">How should we group functions?</span></h2>
<p>How do mechanics group their tools?</p>
<p>How do you group cutleries?</p>
<p>How do you group concepts?</p>
<p>How do you group medicine?</p>
<p>How do you group species?</p>
<p>Why do we group things?</p>
<p>Because they are similar, and so that we can find things faster, and reduce cognitive burden. If we have 5 groups of 100 things each, then we can reason about 500 things as easy as we reason about 5, because we have arranged the groups such that our reasoning about a member of a group generalizes to all members of the same group.</p>
<p>We can group things in a set <span class="math inline">\( T \)</span> by a <em>grouping function</em> <span class="math inline">\( g \)</span> whose domain is <span class="math inline">\( T \)</span>.</p>
<p>Iff <span class="math inline">\( g(x) = g(y) \)</span> then <span class="math inline">\( x \)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( y \)</span> belong to the same group.</p>
<p>We can also write <span class="math inline">\( x \equiv_g y \)</span> for the same thing (&quot;<span class="math inline">\( k \)</span> places <span class="math inline">\( x \)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( y \)</span> into the same group&quot;), if we do not care the exact group, only that they are in the same group.</p>
<p>If the grouping is clear from context, we can write <span class="math inline">\( x \equiv y \)</span> (&quot;<span class="math inline">\( x \)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( y \)</span> are in the same group&quot;).</p>
<p>Equivalence classes in math</p>
<p>Back to things</p>
<p>How are they similar?</p>
<p>By appearance? By purpose?</p>
<p>Suppose you have <em>one million tools</em>. How do you choose and find which ones you need? By the verb that describes the purpose? By the shape? By the motion (pull, push, twist)? By probability/frequency of use?</p>
<p>If we group by the verb, we get groups like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>drill</em> holes in walls</li>
<li><em>drive</em> screws</li>
<li><em>remove</em> nails from walls</li>
<li><em>punch</em> holes in papers</li>
<li><em>suspend</em> heavy objects</li>
<li><em>move</em> soil</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is the essence of drills, to <em>drill</em>, or to merely make a <em>hole</em>? A drill cannot always be replaced with a hole puncher, a gunshot, or a dynamite, although all of them can make holes. If something else were able to make holes as tidy as a drill would make, would that thing be a drill, or be called a &quot;drill&quot;?</p>
<p>We often define tools teleologically (according to their purpose, as how we use them), not ontologically (according to their existence, as what they are).</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming groups functions by the object, not the verb. This does not always make sense.</p>
<p>A programming language should not impose a particular grouping of functions? A namespace should still be loadable although its dependencies are missing, as long as the missing dependencies are not used. Functions have dependencies, not modules.</p>
<p>Suppose you have one million people? How do you find the people you need? By the verb?</p>
<p>&quot;What do you do?&quot; &quot;I program computers&quot;, not &quot;I am a computer programmer&quot;. &quot;What are you?&quot;</p>
<p>The verb is more useful than the &quot;-er&quot; noun. An &quot;-er&quot; noun does not evoke any imagery in our mind. Verbs do.</p>
<p>When I hear &quot;develop&quot;, I can imagine a landscape developing, a plant growing, and thus I can analogize. A verb stimulates imageries and connections in my mind. When I hear &quot;developer&quot;, I see a person, but I don't see him doing anything; he's just standing there, being a developer.</p>
<p>Verbs evoke moving images, changing, dynamic, except stative verbs. Perhaps stative verbs are so named because they evoke static images, not moving images.</p>
<p>Group by the object?</p>
<p>By kind/similarity? By function (the verb in their description)?</p>
<p>If T and U are more likely to be used together than T and V, then T and U should be closer than T and V?</p>
<p>But we don't foresee all possible uses of a tool?</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-criteria-of-good-categorization"><span class="section_number">6</span><span class="section_title">What are the criteria of good categorization?</span></h2>
<p>How do we judge the quality of categories?</p>
