<p><em>Art</em> is everything that manipulates your emotion.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-art"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">Why is art?</span></h2>
<p>The purpose of art is <em>to manipulate emotion</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-beauty"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">What is beauty?</span></h2>
<p><em>Beauty</em> is something that you <em>always want to repeat</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what"><span class="section_number">4</span><span class="section_title">What?</span></h2>
<p>Art exists because we have <em>emotion</em>.</p>
<p>Art is about <em>the manipulation of emotion</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of art is <em>to manipulate emotion</em>.</p>
<p><em>Art</em> is everything that manipulates your emotion.</p>
<p><em>Beauty</em> is something that you <em>always want to repeat</em>. For example, a beautiful person is a person that you want to <em>see</em> again and again; a beautiful music is a piece of music that you want to <em>hear</em> again and again; a beautiful food is a piece of food that you want to <em>eat</em> again and again; a beautiful dress is a article of clothing that you want to <em>wear</em> again and again; thus a beautiful thing is something that you always want to do, make, feel, or experience, again and again.</p>
<p>Most people agree on what is <em>beautiful</em> and what is ugly.</p>
<p>The only way to find out if people find something beautiful is to expose it to them.</p>
<p>A way of measuring the success of a piece of art is how greatly it manipulates how many people's emotions. Therefore, a piece of art either:</p>
<ol>
<li>manipulates a few person a little (example: a sketch made by a child),</li>
<li>manipulates many person a little (example: a median strip),</li>
<li>manipulates a few person greatly (example: a challenging piece of music), or</li>
<li>manipulates many person greatly (example: the songs that just won't die).</li>
</ol>
<p>A piece of art is meaningful only to those whose emotion is influenced by the piece. The beauty of such piece depends on the perceiving person. Without an emotional being to perceive it, art would be a waste of time and materials.</p>
<p>To manipulate people's emotion, your piece of art has to reach them, has to be perceptible by them, has to interact with their senses.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of art.</p>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful person is a walking piece of art, because it manipulates the emotion of the people who see him/her as beautiful.</li>
<li>A beautiful painting of nature that soothes you is a piece of art.</li>
<li>The nice smell of a food being cooked that makes you hungry is an art.</li>
<li>Is also an art, a photo that always makes you smile every time you see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beauty enhances the experience of whatever you are doing. For example, eating the same food but in a more beautiful room will increase the satisfaction, although the food is objectively the same. On the contrary, eating a delicious food besides a rotting carcass ruins the taste of the food, although the food is objectively the same. A successful musical piece manipulates the emotion of most of its listeners, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Art does not exist in a vacuum; framing theory suggests that the <em>context</em> in which a piece of art is presented is important.</p>
<p>If people have to pay for something, they will make up an excuse about how it has to be good, because they don't want to regret their decision, except if the thing is obviously bad.</p>
<h2 id="what-2"><span class="section_number">5</span><span class="section_title">What? 2</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Asset creation mindset</p>
<ul>
<li>The characters and the worlds are the copyrightable Intellectual Property.</li>
<li>Don't write a story. Create a reusable asset.</li>
<li><p>Example: Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks didn't just write a story about rats. They created Mickey Mouse. A mere story about rats would be forgettable. Mickey Mouse continues to live on after Walt Disney died. It becomes something known by lots of people. It's Disney company's asset.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This mindset is applicable to all creators: writers, musicians, songwriters, mangakas, game creators.</li>
<li>Copyright law turns fiction into assets: an article, a song, a musical composition, a recording of a musical composition, a drawing of fictional character (the name itself is not copyrightable, but is trademarkable).</li>
<li>copyright law, trademark law</li>
<li><a href="https://www.aspectlg.com/posts/copyright-in-characters-what-can-i-use">https://www.aspectlg.com/posts/copyright-in-characters-what-can-i-use</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property</a></li>
<li>You can speculate in intellectual property as you speculate in property (real estate). You can speculate on patents as you speculate on land. But speculations aren't always good for society.</li>

            Disqus has been removed because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
            On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website are broken,
            and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
