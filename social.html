<p>We dream of a self-sufficient global sustainable anarchistic society where people freely do what they really want without harming others, where power is distributed. But this dream may change. We are trying to understand what anarchy is, and we disagree with some anarchists. A state has good and bad things.

<h4 id="too-focused-on-economic-growth"><span class="section_number">5.4.1</span><span class="section_title">Too focused on economic growth</span></h4>
<p>Economic growth is not a worthy goal.</p>
<h4 id="the-root-issue-power-centralization"><span class="section_number">5.4.2</span><span class="section_title">The root issue: power centralization?</span></h4>
<p>Both a state and a company are legal fictions for centralizing powers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is a state?</p>
<p>A state is essentially a massive principal-agent problem<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> involving millions of people.</p>
<p>The people give up their monopoly of violence to the state, and the state promises to do good to the people. The problem is principal-agent problem. The state cannot be trusted.</p></li>
<li><p>How can workers empower themselves?</p>
<p>Labor laws and unions are the wrong solution. The correct solution is that the workers must unite and think for themselves, but they must not form a union. Once a union is formed (as a legal entity), it has a life of its own, and the principal-agent problem begins. There is always room and incentive for union bosses to collude with the original enemy, enrich themselves, and betray the original electors. The anarcho-syndicalists get this mostly right (what they get wrong is &quot;revolution&quot;).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Direct action.</p></li>
<li><p>What benefits us is trade, not capitalism</p>
<p>Capitalism contains free trade. Free trade benefits everybody, but the for-profit private ownership of property doesn't always benefit everybody. By free trade, we mean voluntary exchanges/transactions.</p>
<p>It is possible to have free trade without capitalism. Anarchy is an example.</p>
<p>The issue is centralization of power. Companies centralize economic power. States centralize political power. Institutions/organizations centralize power. People must unite, but they must not form unions. Principal-agent problem. Unions have lives of their own.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a company?</p>
<p>It is a physically impossible to build or hurt a company. A company cannot do anything. People do things. A company is a legal fiction for concentrating wealth (economic power) to its shareholders. Such economic power often translates to other forms of power such as political power. A company is rife with principal-agent problems and conflicts of interest. There is one principal-agent problem between the shareholders and the directors. There is another principal-agent problem between the directors and the employees. There is one principal-agent problem for each layer of management. It is amazing that such fiction lasts despite providing ample rooms for corruption.</p></li>
<li><p>But how do we launch rockets without power centralization, without states and companies?</p>
<p>Or build nuclear power plants, or do trillion-dollar engineering projects?</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="is-financial-investing-moral"><span class="section_number">5.4.3</span><span class="section_title">Is financial investing moral?</span></h4>
<p>Financial investing is getting more money without doing anything. It is immoral, because it means indirectly stealing a little from everyone else. We should not glorify rentiers, freeloaders, and thiefs.</p>
<p>But does that mean that passive income, rent, interest, tax, pension fund, and royalty are immoral?</p>
<p>Inflationary monetary policy is immoral, because it steals a little from everyone who trusts the currency.</p>
<h4 id="taxation-capitalism-stealing-from-the-thieves"><span class="section_number">5.4.4</span><span class="section_title">Taxation + capitalism = stealing from the thieves</span></h4>
<p>Taxing the capitalists is stealing from the thieves. Both taxation and capitalism are immoral. Their combination is unnecessarily convoluted. The correct solution is to not have any theft in the first place.</p>
<p>The solution is not taxing the rich. The solution is to remove the law that enables the creation of formal institutions, formal organizations, companies, legal fictions, virtual people, and other power-centralizing entities. People must unite but they must not form a formal union.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-we-care-about-constitutions"><span class="section_number">5.4.5</span><span class="section_title">Why do we care about constitutions?</span></h4>
<p>Why should people in the 21st century agree with people in the 18th century? Why should we agree with people born 300 years ago? We don't even agree with our parents born 30 years ago!</p>
<p>What is a constitution?</p>
<p>USSR 1936 under Stalin<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> had the most beautiful-sounding constitution, but it was only a lip service; the practice was nowhere near that.

<p>One does not have to understand statistics in order to be able to bullshit with statistics.</p>

<p>We do not have to refute the entire bullshit. We only have to point out a fatal flaw, such as a truncated graph, and cause readers to doubt the writer's intention.</p>
<p>A bullshit contains the necessary ingredient to refute itself. A bullshit has an inherent flaw that we can point out without referring to anything outside the bullshit. We just have to point it out. &quot;This is a truncated graph. You are lying.&quot;</p>

<p>Now we understand where power comes from. Evil people have power because we <em>let</em> them. How do we let them?</p>
<p>By being employed by them to perpetuate their evil. Rich people are not destroying the environment. <em>We</em>, their employees, are destroying the environment, by doing what they want us to do. We, the coal miners. We, the power plant operators. We, the car sellers. <em>We are complicit</em>. We <em>let</em> them control us. It is our hands, the workers' hands, not the rich people's hands, who murder the kids, who launches the missiles.</p>
<p><em>All rich people can do is give us money.</em> If we accept that money and we do evil, then we ourselves are at fault.</p>
<p>Companies and rich people are not to blame. We the complicit majority are to be blame. We are sleepwalking. We are not aware of our own power. We have power but we are afraid to use it.</p>
<p>But even if we are not complicit, those rich people will just buy machines and destroy the environment anyway? Therefore they are truly immoral? Why do they take pride in short-term profit maximization? Who taught them?</p>
<p>Government must come from the people. US government is for the rich only, not for the people. The candidates are rich people. The government listens only to rich people. The government does what is good for rich people. There is never a grassroot candidate.</p>
<p>But we have to feed our families. Where do we get money? This is the wrong question. The question is: How do we feed our families? <em>We</em> can farm ourselves. We feed them directly from our own labor. Nature always gives to those who work, to those who hunt, gather, or farm. Nature does not discriminate. Only in nature, those who do not work do not eat. A seed does not care about the color of the hand that sows it.</p>

<p>That sounds very much like the relationship between a lessee (tenant/renter) and a lessor (landlord). A lessee practically will never have enough money to buy the lessor's property; the economic system guarantees that. For example, in 2019, my neighbor is asking IDR 3 billion for his 72-m2 land and house on it. A typical frugal man who saves IDR 3 million monthly salary will need to save for 83 years, assuming over-optimistically zero inflation. He would have died 20 years before he had saved enough to buy the house!</p>
<p>In principle slavery has been abolished, but in practice the economic system guarantees that most people will forever live mediocre lives, although in much better condition than that of ancient Roman slaves. But we can do better.</p>

<p>Food has been the best-selling thing for 40,000 years, but why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?</p>
<p>Here's a thought experiment that leads me to that question.</p>
<p>Imagine an economy that consists of 1 extremely frugal farmer and 1 doctor. After some time, money accumulates at the farmer, because the doctor always needs to eat, but the farmer doesn't always have a health problem.</p>
<p>A government has these options, from the least coercive to the most coercive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing, and hope that the farmer donates his money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Create more money and give it to the doctor. But the farmer may think that this is unfair.</li>
<li>Tax the farmer and give that tax money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Force the farmer to spend his money on the doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current economic system suffers from money accumulation.</p>
<p>Is accumulation of money bad? Is inequality bad?</p>

<p>Trust is the assumption that others will not exploit our vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Everything is vulnerable. Vulnerabilities differ in their probability and the severity, and thus their expected damages. We protect our houses with gates to deter thieves. But we don't protect our houses against meteors. Meteors do more damage than thieves, but meteors are so rare that the expected damage of thieves exceeds the expected damage of meteors. We probabilistically reason that thieves are more risky than meteors.</p>

<li><p>Change the justice system from retributive justice to restorative justice for the non-violent criminals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of locking up prisoners, let them repair the harm they did, and help them reintegrate into society.</li>
<li><p>Millions of people are being incarcerated. Their ability is being wasted. They are deprived of future. They will have difficulties reintegrating into society. Stigmatized. Like the homeless. This stigma makes it impossible for them to get financial stability and get out of the vicious circle of crime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, prison initiation rituals are terrible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are two kinds of criminals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Perforce criminals</em> commit crime to defend themselves from immediate bodily harm that threatens their existence. Examples are hungry moneyless people who steal food, and cornered people who kill. The solution is restorative justice, and giving work to the criminal for financial stability, helping them reintegrate into society.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the threat is removed, perforce criminals no longer commit crime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Non-perforce criminals</em> commit crime for anything else. Examples are psychopaths (people with physical inability to weigh bad consequences because their brains are wired differently). The solution is unbreeding: modify them by gene therapy or psychological therapy or whatever technology, or kill them if they can't change, but only after we have proven that they can't change.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prisons should not exist. There should exist only two kinds of punishment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced labor, for perforce criminals, to repair the harm they did. The state must also help them reintegrate into society.</li>
<li>Death penalty, for non-perforce criminals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In any case, nobody should be locked up for so long. Locking up people wastes resource.</p></li>

<p>A modern government is designed to minimize the damage if a bad person rises to the top, not to maximize the benefit if a good person rises to the top. That is why a republic has checks and balances. The most efficient government is a benevolent competent dictator, but does such person exist?</p>
<p>The government is a monopoly, and it should seek profit for its stakeholders: all its people. Government official corruption, similar to corporate management corruption, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal-agent problem</a>. Everything that solves the principal-agent problem also solves corruption.</p>

<p>Use this quadrant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axis 1: Does it benefit many people?</li>
<li>Axis 2: Does it benefit a few people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that benefit many and benefit few are best left to the private sector with as little regulation as needed to keep the market healthy.</p>
<p>Things that benefit many but disadvantage few should be done by the public sector, because the private sector will not do them because they don't get money doing that. Example: building road.</p>
<p>Things that disadvantage many but benefit few should be prevented by the government. Example: rent-seeking (bribing, lobbying, speculation of non-fungible goods such as land parcels and Internet domain names), crime, terrorism.</p>
<p>Things that disadvantage many and disadvantage few should also be discouraged by the government. Example: road rage, human stupidity.</p>

<p>I do not always agree with Lenin, but I agree with this sentence of his:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it is not immediately apparent which political or social groups, forces or alignments advocate certain proposals, measures, etc., one should always ask: &quot;Who stands to gain?&quot;</p>
<p>Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov a.k.a. Lenin (1870–1924) (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/apr/11.htm">source</a>)</p>

<p>A war between two tribes kills about 100 people. A war between two 11th-century kingdoms<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> kills about 100,000 people. A war between two 20th-century states kills about 1,000,000 people. A war between two 20th-century state-alliances kills about 70,000,000 people. A war between two planetary governments may kill billions of people. This does not yet count the people hurt but not killed by the war.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: the expected damage of wars is constant. A war between two kingdoms is 1,000 times less likely but 1,000 times more destructive than a war between two tribes. For example, if a tribe went to war every day, then a kingdom would go to war every 3 years. But Harrison and Wolf 2012 <span class="citation" data-cites="harrison2012frequency">[<a href="#ref-harrison2012frequency">1</a>]</span> falsifies that hypothesis.</p>

<p>What is an institution? Government bodies? Governing bodies?</p>
<p>Do we need institutions?</p>
<p>Why do we lose trust in institutions?</p>
<p>Institutions enable people to hide. Institutions enable people to abuse power without being held responsible. Institutions deflect blame from people to an abstract entity. Institutions separate the powerful from the coerced. People should be responsible. Instutitions cannot be responsible.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats cannot see reality from their desks alone.</p>
<h3 id="capitalism-has-nothing-to-do-with-free-trade"><span class="section_number">16.3</span><span class="section_title">Capitalism has nothing to do with free trade?</span></h3>
<p>Capitalism is simply the private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Capitalism places capital above labor. Nature places labor above capital: Someone somewhere eventually has to <em>actually do</em> something in order to produce something. <em>Labor is more important than capital.</em> Capitalism goes against nature? Capital without labor will not produce anything. Labor without capital is merely inefficiently allocated.</p>
<p>Capitalism (market?) is a voting about what we should use labor for?</p>

<p>Every man has his own wants.</p>
<p>A voluntary trade betters all parties. But why stop at trade? A voluntary life betters the person.</p>
<p>The ideal society maximizes individual freedom while minimizing harm to the species. Maximizes volition, the will to live. Everyone fearlessly does what they love most. Nobody slaves away at the office.</p>

<p>Consumption is easy. Production is hard. Destruction is easy. Creation is hard. Second law of thermodynamics: The entropy of the Universe never decreases. In nature, entropy never decreases. Disorder arises naturally. The second law of thermodynamics explains why consumption is easier than production.</p>
<p>The nature of economics is that demand is free, but supply is costly.. Changing demand is cheap: you just change your mind. Changing supply is costly: all the infrastructure that has been built won't simply turn back into cash.</p>
<p>Demand first or supply first? Human nature is the root cause of economic demands. There will always be demand for food and shelter. There is always demand to make life easier and less boring.</p>
<p>However, in the case of iPhone, we have two views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve Jobs's presentation causes people to want iPhones. Supply creates demand.</li>
<li>People always want an easier way to live. Steve Jobs's iPhone just happens to make people's lives easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: We want an easier way to live. People don't want iPhones for iPhones's sake. People want iPhones because people believe iPhones make people's lives easier.</p>
<p>If demand surges, it will collapse later. Example: tulip mania.</p>
<h3 id="what-economic-system-is-desirable"><span class="section_number">19.2</span><span class="section_title">What economic system is desirable?</span></h3>
<p>Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed. Cannot centralize power. Cannot be controlled by government.</li>
<li>Cooperative. Competition is a massive waste of human labor. Competitors reinvent each other's wheels all the time. The solution to competition is not competition laws. The solution is cooperation.</li>
<li>Productive instead of consumptive.</li>
<li>Antifragile (Taleb).</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it possible to create an economic system that does not incentivize cheating?</p>
<p>What is the relationship between liberalism, competition, and cooperation?</p>
<p>Economic that is not focused on consumption?</p>
<p>Economic growth usually means consumption growth.</p>
<p>The easiest way to increase GDP is to increase consumption, environment be damned.</p>
<p>Why would we produce anything that nobody will consume?</p>
<h3 id="economic-recession"><span class="section_number">19.3</span><span class="section_title">Economic recession</span></h3>
<p>Economic recession is the reduction of money flow velocity.</p>
<p>How do we predict recession? How do we measure and monitor money flow velocity?</p>
<ul>
<li>people savings balance</li>
<li>mass layoffs</li>
<li>mass price hikes for vital goods (oil?)</li>
<li>company profit/loss statements</li>
<li>money accumulates at few economic actors</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology introduction, demand shift among substitute goods:</p>
<p>A demand shift is a demand collapse and a demand surge.</p>
<p>Cheaper robotic workers (or increasing minimum wages) causes demand for human workers to collapse and demand for robotic workers to surge.</p>
<p>Demand shifts among substitute goods.</p>
<h3 id="fluid-dynamics-explains-economic-recessions"><span class="section_number">19.4</span><span class="section_title">Fluid dynamics explains economic recessions</span></h3>
<p>Economic recession happens because money flow slows down.</p>
<p>Money is a fluid. A fluid flows. Fluid flow velocity depends on pressure at the source and resistances in the path.</p>
<p>If we want to maintain flow velocity despite increasing resistance, we have to increase pressure at the source of the fluid flow. But do we want this?</p>
<p>Money flow slows down because people spend less.</p>
<p>People spend less because they have less discretionary income.</p>
<p>People have less discretionary income because they are fired, or governments raise taxes, or important things get more expensive, etc.</p>
<p>Assumption: A person's behavior changes slowly, if it changes at all. A person who has never cared about the environment will not suddenly care about the environment.</p>
<p>A recession has two possible direct causes: <em>demand collapse</em> or <em>supply collapse</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of supply collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine collapse, oil rig explosion, etc.</li>
<li>Disasters: fire, earthquake, tsunami, flood, volcanic eruption, etc..</li>
<li>Lots of people going out of workforce at once (into pension, dying in war, etc.).</li>
<li>Lots of people suddenly becoming conscious (Google workers demonstrating for transparency, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of demand collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin ran out of fools (greater fool theory).</li>
<li>Renewable energy sources reduce oil demand.</li>
<li>Young people adopt a minimalist lifestyle after realizing that consumerism is unsustainable.</li>
<li>Government increases minimum wage big enough to make switching to robots looks cheap. Lots of companies introduce robot workers at the same time, making human workers redundant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply collapse is caused by physical destruction. Demand collapse is self-inflicted human condition.</p>
<p>Consumers supply demands to producers. Consumers demand supplies from producers. Take and give. To demand is to take, to consume, to destroy. To supply is to give, to produce, to create.</p>
<p>What does inverted yield curve has to do with recession? What does time preference have to do with economic recession? What is an economic recession?</p>
<p>CAGR = compound annualized growth rate.</p>
<p>What is the yield of a bond? A bond's yield is the CAGR of the bond price.</p>
<p>What is the yield curve? The yield curve is the curve in a plot with two axes: the horizontal axis is tenor (duration to maturity), and the vertical axis is yield.</p>
<p>An inverted yield curve indicates that buyers are pessimistic about the bond's future?</p>

<p>A <em>crisis</em> is a mass discontent.</p>
<p>An <em>economic crisis</em> is a mass discontent due to mass reduction of purchasing power.</p>
<p>&quot;A financial crisis is any of a broad variety of situations in which some financial assets suddenly lose a large part of their nominal value.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis</a></p>
<ul>
<li>High firing rate, high unemployment, unemployed people having genuine difficulty finding jobs, employers not willing to employ</li>
<li>Greatly reduced demand (discretionary spending)</li>
<li>Reduced purchasing power</li>
</ul>
<p>Deposits should not be guaranteed. Banks should not lend. Banks can take fees. The job of banks is to clear transactions. Banks exist so that people can transact without physically bringing large amount of cash to the place of transaction. Banks should strive to minimize transaction cost. The job of banks is not to lend. That is the job of credit unions. Banks should not double as creditors.</p>

<ul>
<li>The browser is distributed/P2P.</li>
<li>The browser comes with a search engine that searches your public history or your peers' public history, and distribute indexes to peers.</li>
<li>Block all ads because advertising depends on making people addicted.</li>
<li>Block all popups, no exception, no clickjacking.</li>

<li>Don't load JavaScript by default.</li>
<li>Don't load images by default.</li>
<li>Apply default CSS. Don't load CSS by default.</li>
<li>Enable user-agent spoofing.</li>
<li>For advanced users. No GUI to configure. Write Prolog code to configure the browser.</li>
<li>Default to HTTPS when protocol is not given.</li>
<li>No download manager. Tell the user to use wget, curl, or whatever.</li>
<li>Like emacs but:
<ul>
<li>browser instead of text editor</li>
<li>prolog instead of emacs lisp</li>

<li>Browser must limit memory usage. See entity explosion problem.</li>
<li>Browser should refuse to load HTML documents larger than 1 MB.</li>
<li>User can easily change user agent. WhatsApp wrong browser detection.</li>
<li>combine with caching, peer-to-peer caching, distributed (and social?) searching and ranking and sharing, but what about privacy and the people who try to game the system?</li>
<li>Don't remember tabs when closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limit open tabs to 10. Discourage context-switching. I'm a pathological tab hoarder. Always open a configurable set of tabs on start. If you need to open more tabs, then open a google docs or a note-taking app instead.</p>

<p>Thesis: We should let someone do whatever he/she wants to do as long as he/she doesn't harm others, even if it makes him/her personally worse off.</p>
<p>Now the problem.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't parents let children do what children want as long as children don't harm others? Why do we let an adult smoke cigarette, but we don't let a child smoke cigarette? Why should we prevent children from touching wall sockets, drinking bleaches, and doing other dangerous things? Why should we prevent children from harming themselves? Libertarians are forced to conclude that children aren't people. This conclusion is not inherently bad. We can also define peopleness as a continuum (children are 50% people, for example).</p>
<p>Why should we vaccinate children?</p>

<p>While in government hands, British Petroleum paid too little attention to profitability, constrained by its need to please elected officials who often cared more about keeping energy cheap and employment high. But in private hands, it may have cared about profits far too much, at the expense of other objectives. “BP veered from being a company that made sure nothing blew up to one focusing on cost-cutting at all costs,” Professor Fisman said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/when-privatization-works-and-why-it-doesnt-always.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/when-privatization-works-and-why-it-doesnt-always.html</a></p>

<h3 id="marriage-regulates-copulation-not-procreation"><span class="section_number">21.1</span><span class="section_title">Marriage regulates copulation, not procreation</span></h3>
<p>Marriage regulates <em>copulation</em> (having sex), not procreation (having offsprings).</p>
<p><em>Before</em> marriage has been invented, the society assumes that copulation is allowed by default unless explicitly forbidden (by complaints, disputes, fights, wars, treaties, etc.). <em>After</em> marriage has been invented, the society assumes that copulation is forbidden by default unless explicitly allowed (by marriage). This change of fundamental assumption improves public order.</p>
<p>Copulation and procreation are two <em>orthogonal</em> concepts. Two concepts are orthogonal if we can have one without the other, in both ways.</p>
<p>To <em>copulate</em> is to link / join / bind / tie / couple / bring together / conjoin (the genitals). To copulate is to cause the male genital to be inside the female genital. The male genital protrudes (goes outward). The female genital receives (goes inward).</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copula#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copula#Latin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Copulation is sexual intercourse. Procreation is the production of offspring.</p>
<p>We can have <em>copulation without procreation</em>: inserting the penis into the vagina without ejaculating sperm, even between two married people.</p>
<p>We can have <em>procreation without copulation</em>: cloning, in-vitro fertilization, synthetic organisms.</p>
<p>Marriage is about exclusive copulation, not about procreation.</p>

<p>Do you mind if your spouse copulate with but doesn't procreate with someone else? That is, do you mind if your spouse had sex with someone else as long as nobody gets pregnant? If you do mind that, then marriage is about regulating copulation, not procreation.</p>
<p>Do you mind if you can procreate with but not copulate with your spouse? Consider an average couple. Suppose that the husband's penis and the wife's vagina must never touch, but a third person will, at no cost to the couple, inject the husband's sperm into the wife so that the couple can have a child. Do the average husband and wife mind such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexless_marriage">sexless marriage</a>? If they do, then marriage is about regulating copulation, not procreation.</p>
<p>Marriage, public order, and justification of marriage?</p>
<p>Legally, marriage exists to maintain public order. Biologically, public order exists to maintain survival of the species.</p>
<p>Why does marriage exist?</p>
<p>Marriage exists because the average person gets angry when someone (s)he copulated with copulated with someone else, and this anger may disturb public order. Problem: The definition seems to require that the sexes be different. Is it reasonable to generalize &quot;copulation&quot; into &quot;any sexual act&quot;?</p>
<p>The average person would be angry if his/her spouse have any sexual acts (including flirting and sexual advances) with someone else. It is not only copulation. It is all sexual acts. It is all acts that may reduce the chance of copulation. The average man would be suspicious if his wife begins receiving lavish gifts from another man.</p>
<p>Therefore it is reasonable to generalize marriages to concern the exclusive rights of everything that may lead into copulation, not only copulation.</p>
<p>The debate of marriages boil down to the definition of copulation, and the relationship between copulation and procreation.</p>
<p>Originally copulation was for procreation/reproduction, but then nervous systems evolved, then pleasure centers evolved, and thus copulation evolves to be pleasurable, because otherwise the organism will not reproduce.</p>

<h3 id="general-marriage"><span class="section_number">21.3</span><span class="section_title">General marriage</span></h3>
<p>Contract law subsumes marriage law. The law does not need to define marriages, because ordinary contract law suffices. We can restate marriage terms in <em>contract law terms</em>: cheating is <em>breach</em>, divorce is <em>termination</em>, and alimony is <em>damages</em>.</p>
<p>Usually we think that a marriage is a <em>contract</em> between a person X, a person Y, and their society, stating that:</p>
<ul>
<li>person X and person Y may copulate with each other,</li>
<li>person X must not copulate with anyone else other than person Y,</li>
<li>person Y must not copulate with anyone else other than person X,</li>
<li>the society will help enforce that restriction.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that thinking is too narrow. We can generalize that definition to any arrangement of sexual rights. Two aspects of marriage generalize readily: the <em>number</em>, from only two to any number; and the <em>kinds</em> of allowed sexual activities, from only copulation to any kind of sexual activities. For example, group marriage generalizes the number, and gay marriage generalizes the kind of sexual activities.</p>
<p>Some examples of generalized marriages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group marriage involving a group G of people P1, …, Pn:
<ul>
<li>If person X is in G and person Y is in G, then person X and person Y may copulate.</li>
<li>Everyone in G must not copulate with anyone outside G.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strictly-heterosexual group marriage:
<ul>
<li>Each person X in group G may copulate with each person Y in G if X and Y have different sexes.</li>
<li>Everything else is forbidden.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>General marriage:
<ul>
<li>A marriage is an undirected graph.</li>
<li>An edge (x,y) means that x may copulate with y.</li>
<li>The absence of an edge (x,y) means that x must not copulate with y.</li>
<li>You can see where this is going: complete-graph marriage, point-to-point marriage, bus marriage, star marriage, ring marriage, mesh marriage, daisy-chain marriage, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Classification">other topologies</a> of marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We can even have directed graphs. For example, X may penetrate Y, but Y must not penetrate X.</p>
<p>We can even have multigraphs. We can explicitly list the permitted sexual activities in the contract.</p>
<p>Marriage law is redundant.</p>
<p>Marriage is just a contract that happens to be about sexual rights.</p>
<p>Marriage is about regulating the genitals, not about regulating procreation. When people fuck, they don't think about the next 20 years. They just want to enjoy the moment.</p>

<p>Signing a contract that obliges you is trusting.</p>
<p>Signing a contract that gives you a right is distrusting.</p>
<p>We make a contract because we want the state to help us when the other party breaches the contract. Thus we make a contract because we distrust the other party.</p>
<p>Contracts reduces the amount of trust required for trade.</p>
<p>If the state did not exist, would we still make contracts? We would rely on honor, and not the state.</p>
<p>But underlying every contract is the assumption that the state is honorable.</p>
<p>Contract assumes a third-party enforcer that is powerful and honorable (just, fair, neutral, reliable).</p>

<p>It's amazing that the USA can become the strongest nation in the world, despite the USA's dysfunctional political system.</p>
<p>Imagine what the USA could have been with a functional political system.</p></li>
<li><p>Why they behave that way: because they think short-term. Why do they think short-term? Because there are term limits.</p></li>

<h3 id="purpose"><span class="section_number">26.1</span><span class="section_title">Purpose</span></h3>
<p>The highest law is the will of the people. The people can change the constitution.</p>

<p>Economically, government is to maximize positive externality, and minimize negative externality.</p>
<p>Example negative externality: road congestion due to residential space transforming to commercial space.</p>
<h3 id="policy"><span class="section_number">26.2</span><span class="section_title">Policy</span></h3>
<p>Do the simplest intervention with the least effort, the greatest effect, the least gameability, the least unintended consequences. But those are conflicting requirements.</p>
<p>Example: even-odd license plate based on day of month. People will game this by buying two license plates or buying two vehicles.</p>
<p>Avoid wasting resources on policies that do not attack the root cause of the problem.</p>
<h3 id="murder"><span class="section_number">26.3</span><span class="section_title">Murder</span></h3>
<p>Why is something illegal? Perpetrators are going to perpetrate anyway, and non-perpetrators are not going to perpetrate, regardless of its illegality.</p>
<p>Some people commit crime unwillingly because they want to continue living but they no see other way. Some people are wired differently and commit crime like a pastime.</p>
<p>If something is illegal, why does a perpetrator still do it? Is it futile to make anything illegal? If it were not illegal, will it still be done?</p>
<p>Law cannot change human nature. If you want to change human nature, study biology, not law. Lawmaking must defer to human nature.</p>
<p>It is impossible to enforce a law if millions of people violate it at the same time. If a law is against human nature, of course people will violate it.</p>
<p>Is it moral to force someone who enjoy murder not to murder?</p>
<h3 id="morality"><span class="section_number">26.4</span><span class="section_title">Morality</span></h3>
<p>Government should not interfere in private matter such as religion, insurance, and consensual sex.</p>
<p>If something does not harm anyone else other than the doer, it should not be illegal.</p>
<p>We should help others, but we should to the greatest extent avoid forcing others to do anything against their will even though doing that would be good for them. Consequence: procreation is immoral because it forces people to exist without their consent.</p>
<p>We can persuade, but we should not force, unless we are in war.</p>
<p>Consumption should be taxed, not income.</p>
<p>Alternative to taxation: donation, state-owned enterprise.</p>
<p>Stability.</p>
<p>In a republic, in an election, you don't pick the best candidate; you pick the one that will do the least damage.</p>
<p>Holding a government position should not be profitable. How do we prevent abuse of power? By not giving power in the first place? The people must have the final say.</p>
<h3 id="banning"><span class="section_number">26.5</span><span class="section_title">Banning</span></h3>
<p>Banning something does not eliminate it. Worse, banning it may also create a black market for it.</p>
<p>Regulate, don't ban.</p>
<h3 id="sex"><span class="section_number">26.6</span><span class="section_title">Sex</span></h3>
<p>Blocking access to Internet porn sites does not work.</p>
<p>Banning prostitution creates black market.</p>
<p>Banning sex makes more people more curious.</p>
<p>It's part of human nature.</p>
<p>Family education.</p>
<h3 id="drugs"><span class="section_number">26.7</span><span class="section_title">Drugs</span></h3>
<p>Some people are curious.</p>
<h3 id="patents"><span class="section_number">26.8</span><span class="section_title">Patents</span></h3>
<p>Alternative to patents: Prize system: People collect money for a problem, and the sum is awarded to the inventors who solve the problem.</p>
<p>Another alternative: People can donate to inventors.</p>
<p>Another alternative: Assume that inventors do things because they love to do that, and they want money, but don't want to get filthy rich.</p>
<p>How was the first people who invented spears rewarded, if they were rewarded at all?</p>
<h3 id="prevention-of-mass-destruction"><span class="section_number">26.9</span><span class="section_title">Prevention of mass destruction</span></h3>
<p>How does a government prevent nuclear briefcase detonation, water source poisoning, asteroids hitting Earth, and so on?</p>
<p>The amount of security is inversely proportional to the amount of trust. If you could trust everybody, security would be unnecessary. Republics are complicated because you can't trust the ruler. Republics are designed to minimize the damage done by an evil ruler, not to maximize the benefit done by a competent ruler.</p>
<p>The most efficient government is benevolent competent kind laissez-faire minimalist absolute monarch, but it is also the most risky. Anything can happen if the ruler dies.</p>
<h3 id="differences"><span class="section_number">26.10</span><span class="section_title">Differences</span></h3>
<p>Conventional government assumes that most humans are fundamentally evil. New government assumes that most humans are fundamentally non-evil.</p>
<h3 id="office"><span class="section_number">26.11</span><span class="section_title">Office</span></h3>
<p>If you tell people to do something they don't want, they will do their best to avoid it. If they want to do it, they will do it anyway without your telling them. Thus, you don't tell people. You simply let them do things, help them do things, get out of their way.</p>
<p>If you hire the people who don't want to do the things you want, no amount of salary will fix it. When you hire people, there is an intersection between what they want, what you want, and what your organization wants.</p>
<p>In the office, there are so many things happening that it is too much for one person to keep track what everyone else is doing. You are the only person who knows what you really do. Your supervisor, if any, is the second person to know what you do. Others have even vaguer ideas about what you do. But people can instinctively see whether you're doing well or not, so if you're not doing well, you must pretend that you were doing well, and then suddenly you will do well. If you think you're not doing well, if you doubt yourself, then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if you are absolutely sure that your job is unimportant, even if you keep stumbling, you must unquestioningly believe that you are doing well.</p>
<p>In the office, what you do is less important than what others think you do.</p>
<p>If you don't know what to do, walk around, and talk to people.</p>
<p>If you don't fit in one company, maybe that's the company's fault. But if you have tried three much-different companies and still can't fit, maybe it's your fault.</p>
<p>Make friends. People first. Jobs second.</p>
<p>The number of processes is inversely proportional to the amount of trust.</p>
<p>How much trust are you convenient with?</p>
<p>There are people you naturally gravitate towards, and people you naturally gravitate away from.</p>

<p>If people do not have to do anything, they do what they want to do. Some think; some sing; some exercise; some kill.</p>
<p>Hobbes?</p>
<p>Stable anarchy requires social contract: no one shall be the first to aggress. Peace treaty Honor code Families have stronger bonds than tribes.</p>
<p>Government vs state</p>
<p>Hobbes argues … State of nature government is necessary</p>
<p>Read hobbes leviathan directly</p>
<p>We must not assume that everyone is good.</p>
<p>Axiom: bad people always beat good people.</p>
<p>Suppose that a society consists of 1,000,000 good people and 1 bad person. How do we design the society so that the bad people do not harm others? How differently would we design our society if there were more bad people than good people?</p>
<p>An animal kills only when it is hungry or threatened. A lion with full stomach does not kill a deer. An animal does not kill more than it eats. A lion does not kill two deers if eating one deer suffices to fill up its stomach. The surviving deers do not hold grudges against the lions. The deers do not plot a retaliatory genocide of the lions.</p>
<p>But the more intelligent animals do hold grudges.</p>
<p>A human may kill for fun out of boredom, or out of envy, or other excuses.</p>
<p>It seems that animals are more moral than humans.</p>
<p>Intelligence breeds immorality?</p>
<p>Hobbes makes a strong argument against anarchy.</p>
<p>Hobbes is right about the natural state of humans. People, even some Westerners, did join ISIS.</p>
<h2 id="potential-actualization-waste"><span class="section_number">29</span><span class="section_title">Potential, actualization, waste</span></h2>
<p>Potential is what may be.</p>
<p><em>Waste</em> is failure to actualize potential. Failure is final and irreversible.</p>
<p>The goal of a state is to ensure freedom for each person to actualize his/her potential, pursue greatness</p>
<p>Why do we feel bad wasting?</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-extinction"><span class="section_number">30</span><span class="section_title">Avoiding extinction</span></h2>
<p>There are two ways for humans to avoid extinction: a political way and a biological way. The political way is to create a political system that does not depend on human benevolence. The biological way is to technologically alter the nature of humans. The political way is much simpler.</p>

<p>By hiring I mean employment/wage/salary.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about anarchistic labor, a form of voluntary labor that is not subject to labor laws. Get paid by result not by time. Work anywhere. Resign anytime. No non-competes, no non-disclosures, no grace periods. Work on something ethical and meaningful.</p>

<p>It is impractical to raise kids while working, but not while being employed.</p>
<p>My guess of division of labor in stone age: Able men and childless women find food. Women and old men raise children.</p>
<p>In stone age there are no 8-hour work days. Men work only as much as needed to live that day. The rest is free time: sleep, play, art, sex, rough-and-tumble, musing, thinking</p>

<p>How one becomes a fascist: He feels that democracy goes nowhere. He realizes that people don't change. People don't care. Politicians are corrupt. Government doesn't help him. Cities are unwalkable. He feels the system is rigged against him. He begins isolating himself. He continues to think. As he thinks, he becomes more extreme. He reinforces his beliefs. He confirms his own biases. He goes online. He meets people who feel the same. He is young and impatient. He wants to see changes right now, if not yesterday.</p>
<p>A person needs a justification for his existence. If he thinks that the system is corrupt and is rigged against him, he will think that his violence is justified.</p>
