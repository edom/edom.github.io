<h3 id="key-idea-morality-intention-and-causality-are-inseparable"><span class="section_number">2.1</span><span class="section_title">Key idea: Morality, intention, and causality are inseparable</span></h3>
<p>Morality cannot be determined by merely looking at the outcomes. Determining morality requires knowing intention and understanding the chain of causes.</p>
<p>Why does intention matter? How do we know others' intentions?</p>
<h3 id="inaction-can-be-a-contributing-factor-but-not-a-cause"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">Inaction can be a contributing factor, but not a cause</span></h3>
<p>Key idea: Inaction cannot be a cause, but inaction can be a contributing factor. A contributing factor shares some blame.</p>
<p>About the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a>, utilitarianism suggests killing the lowest number of people, but our innate morality suggests <em>unconditional inaction</em>. We refuse to interfere with the natural course of events.</p>
<p>Guilt, harm, blame, and causality:</p>
<p>This suggests that our moral principle may be &quot;do not <em>cause</em> harm&quot;. This suggests that we feel <em>guilt</em> when we cause harm. Blaming requires understanding causality.</p>
<p>If I don't do anything, then I have <em>less</em> responsibility if the runaway tram crashes into people. If I switch, I have <em>more</em> responsibility.</p>
<p>The solution to the trolley problem: Inaction cannot be a cause, but can be a contributing factor. If you do not act, then your existence does not affect the natural course of events.</p>
<p>The runaway tram problem differs from the crashing airliner problem. The airliner pilot has a third option: killing everyone on the plane. The tram driver doesn't have that option.</p>
<p>What do we evolve morality for?</p>
<p>Morality improves species survival, but does not maximize species survival. Here's a proof by contradiction. Suppose that it is moral to do everything that promotes survival of the species. Quandary: the utilitarian doctor kills 1 patient to save 5 patients. But we feel that this is immoral. Why don't doctors kill people to save more people? Why do we prefer letting people die to making people die? <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/</a></p>
<p>Suppose that two men are starving. It is moral for a man to sacrifice himself to be eaten by the other man, but it is immoral for a man to sacrifice-and-eat the other man. Why is this asymmetry? There are four possible actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>X kills X. Y eats X's carcass.</li>
<li>X kills Y. X eats Y's carcass.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>The outcome is the same: one of them will die anyway. Why is self-sacrifice moral? Why is Jesus the most moral person?</p>
<p>We are willing to sacrifice ourselves in an impending doom, in a hopeless situation; but we refuse to sacrifice ourselves so that the utilitarian doctor may save 5 other people. If we are going to die 5 hours from now, then dying an hour earlier doesn't make a difference. We are willing to sacrifice one day of life expectancy, but not 60 years of life expectancy. Why does our willingness to sacrifice depend on how long we expect to live? Why does our willingness to sacrifice depend on how far we look into the future? A young suicidal man readily sacrifices himself while knowing that he would expect himself to live for 60 more years if he didn't kill himself? Does a suicidal person know that a human, on average, lives for 80 years? What does a suicidal person think about life expectancy? How long do you expect to live? I want to live forever.</p>
<p>The opposite of a suicidal person is a person who wants to live forever?</p>
<p>One thing is clear in our evolved morality: It is moral to harm oneself, but it is immoral to harm others. Did we evolve altruism?</p>
<p>Suppose two groups. Actively harms others. Avoids harming others.</p>
<p>Which is true? We evolve morality so that we may form groups. Or. We form groups so that we may evolve morality.</p>
<p>Morality is what is required to form a group. A group can only exist if most of its members are moral. Morality is whatever prevents the collapse of the group. ???</p>
<p>How do we balance the individual's will to live and the group's survival?</p>
<p>Morality evolved to minimize feeling guilty?</p>
<p>Morality evolves to minimize the harm that a group inflicts to its members?</p>
<p>Why do we feel guilty?</p>
<p>Feeling guilty requires knowing causality. We feel guilty because we think we cause harm.</p>
<p>Imagining evil vs doing evil</p>
<p>Relationship between morality, agency, cause, guilt?</p>
<p>What is the relationship between intention and morality? Is it moral: an action with good intention but bad outcome?</p>

<h4 id="abortion-debates-are-futile-communication-failures"><span class="section_number">2.4.1</span><span class="section_title">Abortion debates are futile communication failures</span></h4>
<p>&lt;2018-09-15&gt;</p>
<p>TLDR: Before you debate abortion, make sure everyone has the same definition of the words you're going to use.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The problem with abortion debates</p>
<p>Abortion debate is all emotion and no thinking. Nothing will ever come out of it. There is no real discussion. The participants don't even agree on the meaning of the words they use (human, fetus, life, species, murder). It is communication failure. It is religious debate.</p>
<p>Everyone gives different meanings to the same word. Everyone assumes everyone else has the same definitions. There is only an illusion of communication. There is no real progress.</p>
<p>New York Times has some <a href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/on-abortion-and-defining-a-person/">opinion</a> about language in abortion debates.</p></li>
<li><p>Abortion debate is battle between thinkers and feelers</p>
<p>After seeing <a href="https://abortion.procon.org/">Abortion ProCon.org</a>, I realize that the debate is just a battle between thinkers and feelers. Generally, thinkers are pro-abortion and feelers are anti-abortion.</p>
<p>After browsing around, I realize that gun control, euthanasia, death penalty, and other moral issues are just a giant battle between thinkers and feelers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ubiquitous problem: not defining what a human is</p>
<p>What is a human? We think we know what a human is, but when we want to say it, we find out we can't. Why? Is our language limited? Is &quot;human&quot; an ill-defined concept?</p>
<p>We don't know what a human is, we don't know what life is, but we dare to debate the sanctity of the life of a human?</p>
<p>People who debate abortion but can't define human are wasting time. They don't know what they're talking about.</p></li>
<li><p>Ubiquitous fallacy: binarizing the continuum</p>
<p>Concepts such as hot, tall, big are not binary. They are continuums.</p>
<p>Life is not binary. It is a continuum. We are more alive when we wake up. We are less alive when we sleep. We are even less alive when we die.</p>
<p>Being human is a continuum.</p>
<p>Truth is a continuum. We reason probabilistically.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do we care what others do?</p>
<p>We care about what others do only as far as how they may harm us.</p>
<p>We don't care when someone harms himself.</p>
<p>We care when someone harms others, but only if he may harm us.</p>
<p>We care when someone kills people because we fear he may kill us next, not because we care about the people he killed.</p>
<p>We care when someone kills his children because we fear he may kill our children next, not because we care about the children he killed.</p>
<p>Why do we care when a pregnant woman aborts her fetus?</p>
<p>We care when a woman aborts her fetus because we want to impose our morality on others, not because we care about the fetus. If we cared about the fetus, we would help the mother raise the fetus, help her give birth, and then adopt the baby.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>Dennis Prager</p>
<p>Dennis Prager has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMwkQVpy98A">video about abortion</a>.</p>
<p>What he gets right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right: &quot;When challenged with this argument, people usually change the subject to the rights of the mother.&quot;
<ul>
<li>The right response is to ask the claimant to define the words human, species, life, fetus, etc. There is no need to digress to mother rights in order to point out the problems with the argument.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What he gets wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing unrelated concepts in a loaded question: &quot;Does the human fetus have any value and any rights?&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Value&quot; is a moral concept. &quot;Rights&quot; is a legal concept. The two don't always coincide. Also, he hadn't defined what a &quot;human&quot; is.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Misuse of language: &quot;A living being doesn't have to be a person in order to have intrinsic moral value and rights.&quot;
<ul>
<li>The term &quot;intrinsic rights&quot; is an oxymoron. Your rights are the things laws give you. They don't come with you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wrong: &quot;Either a human fetus has worth or it doesn't.&quot;
<ul>
<li>This is the fallacy of binarizing the continuum.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loaded question: &quot;Why does one person, a mother, get to determine whether that being has any right to live?&quot;
<ul>
<li>The question should have been: &quot;Why does <em>anyone</em> at all get to determine whether any being has any right to live?&quot;
<ul>
<li>That question suggests antinatalism. Why do we force babies to come into being?</li>

<p>There are always problems with moral systems? Ethical dilemmas: no universal morality? <a href="https://philosophynow.org/issues/60/Why_You_Shouldnt_Be_A_Person_Of_Principle">https://philosophynow.org/issues/60/Why_You_Shouldnt_Be_A_Person_Of_Principle</a></p>
<p>If every moral system is problematic, why should we have any moral system?</p>
<p>Egocentric survivalism's answer to trolley problem is &quot;It doesn't matter what you do, because it doesn't have anything to do with your survival.&quot;</p>
<p>Chance-survivalism's answer to trolley problem is &quot;You should act in the way that maximizes the human race's chance of survival.&quot; But you don't know who to save for the best survival of the human race.</p>
<p>Problem: If the 5 people are all homosexual, and the 1 person is heterosexual, then chance-survivalism implies that you should direct the train to the 5 homosexual people? What if those 5 homosexuals found a cure to cancer, and that heterosexual became a war criminal? What if the other way around?</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-prioritizing-individual-survival-over-species-survival"><span class="section_number">3.2</span><span class="section_title">The problem with prioritizing individual survival over species survival</span></h3>
<p>Survivalism suffers this problem. Consider this dilemma: A superpowered alien abducts you, starves you, and offers you two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you eat the food, then he destroys the Earth, killing all humans on Earth.</li>
<li>If you don't eat the food, then he leaves the Earth alone.</li>

<p>Consider this &quot;doomsday spaceship&quot; scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>A huge asteroid will hit the Earth 1 week from now. That will kill all 7 billion people.</li>
<li>But we have one spaceship that can save 1000 people. That is the only way out of Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which people should we save? Why? There is no satisfactory answer to this; we should just use a truly random lottery. But if we pick people randomly, the ship will be full of poor people, because the majority of the Earth is poor. Should pregnant women be prioritized before non-pregnant women? Should older women be prioritized before younger women? Should women be prioritized before men? Should children be prioritized before women? Nobody should be prioritized. If we don't pick people randomly, then we don't practice what we preach about equality.</p>
<p>With a lottery, all 7 billion people have a chance to board the spaceship, but it is physically impossible for all 7 billion people to actually board the spaceship. No amount of political correctness will change the laws of nature.</p>
<p>Of course, when the spaceship is big enough for 7 billion people, we can have equality of outcome. The question is how we make a spaceship that big.</p>

Self-defense can justify killing. Why can't self-defense justify stealing? Should intentional killing be more wrong than unintentional killing? Rioting is wrong.

<h3 id="formalizing-quandary-free-moral-systems"><span class="section_number">4.2</span><span class="section_title">Formalizing quandary-free moral systems</span></h3>
<p>Key ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>A moral system is a formal system that contains modal logic.</li>
<li>A quandary is a formula with the shape &quot;(must S) and (must not S)&quot;.</li>
<li>Conjecture: If a moral system only requires or only forbids but never both requires and forbids, then it won't have quandaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>A moral system is a <em>formal system</em> that contains modal logic. A formal system has a formal language, a set of axioms, and a set of inference rules. A formal language has an alphabet and a grammar (a set of formation rules).</p>
<p>&quot;Moral system&quot; is sometimes also called &quot;morality&quot;.</p>
<p>Two kinds of moral statements are <em>requirement</em> and <em>forbiddance</em>. Synonyms for &quot;requirement&quot; are necessity, obligation, duty. Synonyms for &quot;forbiddance&quot; are prohibition, restriction.</p>
<p>A <em>quandary</em> is a formula with the shape &quot;(must S) and (must not S)&quot;.</p>
<p>A quandary is almost a contradiction. A contradiction is both true and false; likewise, a quandary both requires and forbids. Compare the difference in where the &quot;not&quot; is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quandary has the shape &quot;(must S) and (must <em>not</em> S)&quot;.</li>
<li>A contradiction has the shape &quot;(must S) and <em>not</em> (must S)&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note about language: in this discussion, we never write &quot;you must <em>avoid harming</em> others&quot;; we always write &quot;you must <em>not harm</em> others&quot;. We don't use negative verbs such as &quot;avoid&quot; in a formal moral system; we use only positive verbs in this discussion.</p>
<h3 id="explicating-our-innate-moral-system-1"><span class="section_number">4.3</span><span class="section_title">Explicating our innate moral system</span></h3>
<p>Here we are going to repeat these until we arrive at a quandary-free moral system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose a universal moral principle that at first seems good.</li>
<li>Find that it raises a quandary.</li>
<li>Revise the moral principle to immunize it against the quandary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we try to state our innate moral system in English.</p>
<p>Given an action, most people agree on whether that action is good or bad, but most people cannot satisfactorily define what good is and what bad is.</p>
<p>What I think we believe is moral:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retaliating.</li>
<li>Forcing children to do things for their own good.</li>
</ul>

<p>Food has been the best-selling thing for 40,000 years, but why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?</p>
<p>Here's a thought experiment that leads me to that question.</p>
<p>Imagine an economy that consists of 1 extremely frugal farmer and 1 doctor. After some time, money accumulates at the farmer, because the doctor always needs to eat, but the farmer doesn't always have a health problem.</p>
<p>A government has these options, from the least coercive to the most coercive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing, and hope that the farmer donates his money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Create more money and give it to the doctor. But the farmer may think that this is unfair.</li>
<li>Tax the farmer and give that tax money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Force the farmer to spend his money on the doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current economic system suffers from money accumulation.</p>
<p>Is accumulation of money bad? Is inequality bad?</p>

<p>What is &quot;economy&quot;? What is &quot;economy&quot; in &quot;economic meltdown&quot;?</p>
<p>Exchange? Trade?</p>
<p>Satisfy maximum wants using minimum resources. There are two solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce wants.</li>
<li>Use more resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economics is easy to explain but hard to predict. Economics is too interconnected.</p>
<p>Demand/consumption is easy; supply/production is hard.</p>
<p><em>Demand is easy.</em> We can want anything. Changing our minds is free.</p>
<p><em>Supply is hard.</em> We have to work to satisfy our demands.</p>
<p>Consumption is easy. Production is hard. Destruction is easy. Creation is hard. Second law of thermodynamics: The entropy of the Universe never decreases. In nature, entropy never decreases. Disorder arises naturally. The second law of thermodynamics explains why consumption is easier than production.</p>
<p>The nature of economics is that demand is free, but supply is costly.. Changing demand is cheap: you just change your mind. Changing supply is costly: all the infrastructure that has been built won't simply turn back into cash.</p>
<p>Demand first or supply first? Human nature is the root cause of economic demands. There will always be demand for food and shelter. There is always demand to make life easier and less boring.</p>
<p>However, in the case of iPhone, we have two views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve Jobs's presentation causes people to want iPhones. Supply creates demand.</li>
<li>People always want an easier way to live. Steve Jobs's iPhone just happens to make people's lives easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: We want an easier way to live. People don't want iPhones for iPhones's sake. People want iPhones because people believe iPhones make people's lives easier.</p>
<p>If demand surges, it will collapse later. Example: tulip mania.</p>
<h3 id="what-economic-system-is-desirable"><span class="section_number">7.2</span><span class="section_title">What economic system is desirable?</span></h3>
<p>Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed. Cannot centralize power. Cannot be controlled by government.</li>
<li>Cooperative. Competition is wasteful. Every competing company reinvents the wheel. Massive waste of human labor.</li>
<li>Productive instead of consumptive.</li>
<li>Antifragile (Taleb).</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it possible to create an economic system that does not incentivize cheating?</p>
<p>What is the relationship between liberalism, competition, and cooperation?</p>
<p>Economic that is not focused on consumption?</p>
<p>Economic growth usually means consumption growth.</p>
<p>The easiest way to increase GDP is to increase consumption, environment be damned.</p>
<p>Why would we produce anything that nobody will consume?</p>
<h3 id="economic-recession"><span class="section_number">7.3</span><span class="section_title">Economic recession</span></h3>
<p>Economic recession is the reduction of money flow velocity.</p>
<p>How do we predict recession? How do we measure and monitor money flow velocity?</p>
<ul>
<li>people savings balance</li>
<li>mass layoffs</li>
<li>mass price hikes for vital goods (oil?)</li>
<li>company profit/loss statements</li>
<li>money accumulates at few economic actors</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology introduction, demand shift among substitute goods:</p>
<p>A demand shift is a demand collapse and a demand surge.</p>
<p>Cheaper robotic workers (or increasing minimum wages) causes demand for human workers to collapse and demand for robotic workers to surge.</p>
<p>Demand shifts among substitute goods.</p>
<h3 id="fluid-dynamics-explains-economic-recessions"><span class="section_number">7.4</span><span class="section_title">Fluid dynamics explains economic recessions</span></h3>
<p>Economic recession happens because money flow slows down.</p>
<p>Money is a fluid. A fluid flows. Fluid flow velocity depends on pressure at the source and resistances in the path.</p>
<p>If we want to maintain flow velocity despite increasing resistance, we have to increase pressure at the source of the fluid flow. But do we want this?</p>
<p>Money flow slows down because people spend less.</p>
<p>People spend less because they have less discretionary income.</p>
<p>People have less discretionary income because they are fired, or governments raise taxes, or important things get more expensive, etc.</p>
<p>Assumption: A person's behavior changes slowly, if it changes at all. A person who has never cared about the environment will not suddenly care about the environment.</p>
<p>A recession has two possible direct causes: <em>demand collapse</em> or <em>supply collapse</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of supply collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine collapse, oil rig explosion, etc.</li>
<li>Disasters: fire, earthquake, tsunami, flood, volcanic eruption, etc..</li>
<li>Lots of people going out of workforce at once (into pension, dying in war, etc.).</li>
<li>Lots of people suddenly becoming conscious (Google workers demonstrating for transparency, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of demand collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin ran out of fools (greater fool theory).</li>
<li>Renewable energy sources reduce oil demand.</li>
<li>Young people adopt a minimalist lifestyle after realizing that consumerism is unsustainable.</li>
<li>Government increases minimum wage big enough to make switching to robots looks cheap. Lots of companies introduce robot workers at the same time, making human workers redundant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply collapse is caused by physical destruction. Demand collapse is self-inflicted human condition.</p>
<p>Consumers supply demands to producers. Consumers demand supplies from producers. Take and give. To demand is to take, to consume, to destroy. To supply is to give, to produce, to create.</p>

<p>Deposits should not be guaranteed. Banks should not lend. Banks can take fees. The job of banks is to clear transactions. Banks exist so that people can transact without physically bringing large amount of cash to the place of transaction. Banks should strive to minimize transaction cost. The job of banks is not to lend. That is the job of credit unions. Banks should not double as creditors.</p>

<p>Principle: the user should have maximum control.</p>
<p>It is not only a browser. It is a tool for controlling your web experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser is distributed/P2P.</li>
<li>The browser comes with a search engine that searches your public history or your peers' public history, and distribute indexes to peers.</li>
<li>Block all ads because advertising depends on making people addicted.</li>
<li>Block all popups, no exception, no clickjacking.</li>
<li>Block all &quot;soft-popups&quot; (displays).</li>
<li>Run user script for certain websites.</li>
<li>Block all cookies by default.</li>
<li>Don't load JavaScript by default.</li>
<li>Don't load images by default.</li>
<li>Apply default CSS. Don't load CSS by default.</li>
<li>Enable user-agent spoofing.</li>
<li>For advanced users. No GUI to configure. Write Prolog code to configure the browser.</li>
<li>Default to HTTPS when protocol is not given.</li>
<li>No download manager. Tell the user to use wget, curl, or whatever.</li>
<li>Like emacs but:
<ul>
<li>browser instead of text editor</li>
<li>prolog instead of emacs lisp</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Browser must limit memory usage. See entity explosion problem.</li>
<li>Browser should refuse to load HTML documents larger than 1 MB.</li>
<li>User can easily change user agent. WhatsApp wrong browser detection.</li>
<li>combine with caching, peer-to-peer caching, distributed (and social?) searching and ranking and sharing, but what about privacy and the people who try to game the system?</li>
<li>Don't remember tabs when closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limit open tabs to 10. Discourage context-switching. I'm a pathological tab hoarder. Always open a configurable set of tabs on start. If you need to open more tabs, then open a google docs or a note-taking app instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a fast, private, and secure web browser in Prolog.

<li>Features:
<ul>
<li>Selectively enable JavaScript from some websites with Prolog rules.</li>
<li>Disable clipboard hook.</li>

<p>Thesis: We should let someone do whatever he/she wants to do as long as he/she doesn't harm others, even if it makes him/her personally worse off.</p>
<p>Now the problem.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't parents let children do what children want as long as children don't harm others? Why do we let an adult smoke cigarette, but we don't let a child smoke cigarette? Why should we prevent children from touching wall sockets, drinking bleaches, and doing other dangerous things? Why should we prevent children from harming themselves? Libertarians are forced to conclude that children aren't people. This conclusion is not inherently bad. We can also define peopleness as a continuum (children are 50% people, for example).</p>
<p>Why should we vaccinate children?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Libertarianism-When-do-children-own-themselves-if-at-all">https://www.quora.com/Libertarianism-When-do-children-own-themselves-if-at-all</a></p>
<p>However, an antinatalist libertarian wouldn't have this problem, because having children would be immoral in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/6356ym/shouldnt_libertarians_be_anti_natalist/">https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/6356ym/shouldnt_libertarians_be_anti_natalist/</a></p>
<p>Our language implies that children aren't people.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the pronoun &quot;it&quot; to refer to a child.</li>
<li>Casualty count (death toll) is categorized into &quot;men&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, and &quot;children&quot;.</li>
<li>We sometimes use the phrase &quot;men, women, and children&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is in the language. &quot;Person&quot; is not a binary concept; it's a continuum. A child may be 20% personlike. The more personlike something is, the more we should treat it as a person.</p>

<p>While in government hands, British Petroleum paid too little attention to profitability, constrained by its need to please elected officials who often cared more about keeping energy cheap and employment high. But in private hands, it may have cared about profits far too much, at the expense of other objectives. “BP veered from being a company that made sure nothing blew up to one focusing on cost-cutting at all costs,” Professor Fisman said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/when-privatization-works-and-why-it-doesnt-always.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/when-privatization-works-and-why-it-doesnt-always.html</a></p>

<h3 id="marriage-regulates-copulation-not-procreation"><span class="section_number">9.1</span><span class="section_title">Marriage regulates copulation, not procreation</span></h3>
<p>Marriage regulates <em>copulation</em> (having sex), not procreation (having offsprings).</p>
<p><em>Before</em> marriage has been invented, the society assumes that copulation is allowed by default unless explicitly forbidden (by complaints, disputes, fights, wars, treaties, etc.). <em>After</em> marriage has been invented, the society assumes that copulation is forbidden by default unless explicitly allowed (by marriage). This change of fundamental assumption improves public order.</p>
<p>Copulation and procreation are two <em>orthogonal</em> concepts. Two concepts are orthogonal if we can have one without the other, in both ways.</p>
<p>To <em>copulate</em> is to link / join / bind / tie / couple / bring together / conjoin (the genitals). To copulate is to cause the male genital to be inside the female genital. The male genital protrudes (goes outward). The female genital receives (goes inward).</p>

</ul>
<p>Copulation is sexual intercourse. Procreation is the production of offspring.</p>
<p>We can have <em>copulation without procreation</em>: inserting the penis into the vagina without ejaculating sperm, even between two married people.</p>
<p>We can have <em>procreation without copulation</em>: cloning, in-vitro fertilization, synthetic organisms.</p>
<p>Marriage is about exclusive copulation, not about procreation.</p>

<h4 id="pro-marriage-regulates-copulation-not-procreation"><span class="section_number">9.2.1</span><span class="section_title">Pro: Marriage regulates copulation, not procreation</span></h4>
<p>Do you mind if your spouse copulate with but doesn't procreate with someone else? That is, do you mind if your spouse had sex with someone else as long as nobody gets pregnant? If you do mind that, then marriage is about regulating copulation, not procreation.</p>
<p>Do you mind if you can procreate with but not copulate with your spouse? Consider an average couple. Suppose that the husband's penis and the wife's vagina must never touch, but a third person will, at no cost to the couple, inject the husband's sperm into the wife so that the couple can have a child. Do the average husband and wife mind such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexless_marriage">sexless marriage</a>? If they do, then marriage is about regulating copulation, not procreation.</p>
<p>Marriage, public order, and justification of marriage?</p>
<p>Legally, marriage exists to maintain public order. Biologically, public order exists to maintain survival of the species.</p>
<p>Why does marriage exist?</p>
<p>Marriage exists because the average person gets angry when someone (s)he copulated with copulated with someone else, and this anger may disturb public order. Problem: The definition seems to require that the sexes be different. Is it reasonable to generalize &quot;copulation&quot; into &quot;any sexual act&quot;?</p>
<p>The average person would be angry if his/her spouse have any sexual acts (including flirting and sexual advances) with someone else. It is not only copulation. It is all sexual acts. It is all acts that may reduce the chance of copulation. The average man would be suspicious if his wife begins receiving lavish gifts from another man.</p>
<p>Therefore it is reasonable to generalize marriages to concern the exclusive rights of everything that may lead into copulation, not only copulation.</p>
<p>The debate of marriages boil down to the definition of copulation, and the relationship between copulation and procreation.</p>
<p>Originally copulation was for procreation/reproduction, but then nervous systems evolved, then pleasure centers evolved, and thus copulation evolves to be pleasurable, because otherwise the organism will not reproduce.</p>

<h3 id="general-marriage"><span class="section_number">9.3</span><span class="section_title">General marriage</span></h3>
<p>Contract law subsumes marriage law. The law does not need to define marriages, because ordinary contract law suffices. We can restate marriage terms in <em>contract law terms</em>: cheating is <em>breach</em>, divorce is <em>termination</em>, and alimony is <em>damages</em>.</p>
<p>Usually we think that a marriage is a <em>contract</em> between a person X, a person Y, and their society, stating that:</p>
<ul>
<li>person X and person Y may copulate with each other,</li>
<li>person X must not copulate with anyone else other than person Y,</li>
<li>person Y must not copulate with anyone else other than person X,</li>
<li>the society will help enforce that restriction.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that thinking is too narrow. We can generalize that definition to any arrangement of sexual rights. Two aspects of marriage generalize readily: the <em>number</em>, from only two to any number; and the <em>kinds</em> of allowed sexual activities, from only copulation to any kind of sexual activities. For example, group marriage generalizes the number, and gay marriage generalizes the kind of sexual activities.</p>
<p>Some examples of generalized marriages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group marriage involving a group G of people P1, …, Pn:
<ul>
<li>If person X is in G and person Y is in G, then person X and person Y may copulate.</li>
<li>Everyone in G must not copulate with anyone outside G.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strictly-heterosexual group marriage:
<ul>
<li>Each person X in group G may copulate with each person Y in G if X and Y have different sexes.</li>
<li>Everything else is forbidden.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>General marriage:
<ul>
<li>A marriage is an undirected graph.</li>
<li>An edge (x,y) means that x may copulate with y.</li>
<li>The absence of an edge (x,y) means that x must not copulate with y.</li>
<li>You can see where this is going: complete-graph marriage, point-to-point marriage, bus marriage, star marriage, ring marriage, mesh marriage, daisy-chain marriage, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Classification">other topologies</a> of marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We can even have directed graphs. For example, X may penetrate Y, but Y must not penetrate X.</p>
<p>We can even have multigraphs. We can explicitly list the permitted sexual activities in the contract.</p>
<p>Marriage law is redundant.</p>
<p>Marriage is just a contract that happens to be about sexual rights.</p>
<p>Marriage is about regulating the genitals, not about regulating procreation. When people fuck, they don't think about the next 20 years. They just want to enjoy the moment.</p>
<p>Relationship between marriage, graph theory, and model theory: What is the shortest first-order logic formula that describes a graph that describes a marriage?</p>

<h2 id="contract-is-distrust"><span class="section_number">10</span><span class="section_title">Contract is distrust</span></h2>
<p>We make a contract because we want the state to help us when the other party breaches the contract. Thus we make a contract because we distrust the other party.</p>
<p>Contracts reduces the amount of trust required for trade.</p>
<p>If the state did not exist, would we still make contracts? We would rely on honor, and not the state.</p>
<p>But underlying every contract is the assumption that the state is honorable.</p>
<p>Contract assumes a third-party enforcer that is powerful and honorable (just, fair, neutral, reliable).</p>

<p>Government should abolish minimum wage law. Everyone should know everyone else's salary. Worker union is about collective bargaining power, not about formal organization. The moment a worker union is made a formal organization, it gets its own life, and it starts to benefit itself; it stops to benefit the workers.</p>

<p>Government doesn't need to intervene in Tylenol scare. Free market can handle that. If the producers don't find a better packaging, people simply won't buy. Consumers simply have to tell what they want to the producers.</p>

<p>How do you host something without being liable for it? For example, someone uploads porn to your distributed network.</p>
<p>Encryption-at-rest, and in transit, with tamper-resistant private key that self-destructs readily?</p>
<p>Even simpler. Split the file into several parts, and host each part in different host. Sorites paradox. At how many bytes does a file contain porn? If everyone is a criminal, then nobody is a criminal.</p>
<p>Currency tied to food price. A meal should be nutritious and nourishing and healthy. $1 = 1 meal. Labor that enables the meal. $1 = cooking 5 meals. The cook creates a value of $5 but gets paid only $1. Let everything be market. $? = Creating a technology that enables us to make more meals. $1 = protection for 8 hours. How should we value art, programming, etc.? Let the market decide! How does software enable us to create more meals?</p>
<p>If everyone takes more value than they create, the system collapses.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting is not a solution. It's still centralized. Your cloud provider decides what to host. Government can crack cloud providers down.</p>

Everyone issues his own banknotes, like banks before Federal Reserve existed. I issue a note &quot;I owe John 5 meals&quot;. Everyone issues his own notes, and let the market exchange works it out. A note is a certificate of debt. X did something for Y. Y did something for Z. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency</a> Free banking Private digital fiat complementary currency Trusted third party guarantees notes? A guarantor ensures that private notes are convertible to meals, for example by ensuring convertibility to USD. A guarantor is responsible for checking that the issuer has the assets to back the issued notes, because a note is a certificate of debt. A guarantor should personally know the issuer. A guarantor limits the amount of currency an issuer can issue. Credit US dollar: If I give you C$1, it means I owe you $1.</p>
<p>Food sellers issue their own currencies. For example, I can produce 100 meals, and I sell each meal for $1.</p>
<p>Big Mac credit A McDonalds outlet takes 1 BMC and gives 1 Big Mac. A McDonalds outlet issues 1 BMC for each Big Mac it can produce immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Change the justice system from retributive justice to restorative justice for the non-violent criminals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of locking up prisoners, let them repair the harm they did, and help them reintegrate into society.</li>
<li><p>Millions of people are being incarcerated. Their ability is being wasted. They are deprived of future. They will have difficulties reintegrating into society. Stigmatized. Like the homeless. This stigma makes it impossible for them to get financial stability and get out of the vicious circle of crime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, prison initiation rituals are terrible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are two kinds of criminals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Perforce criminals</em> commit crime to defend themselves from immediate bodily harm that threatens their existence. Examples are hungry moneyless people who steal food, and cornered people who kill. The solution is restorative justice, and giving work to the criminal for financial stability, helping them reintegrate into society.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the threat is removed, perforce criminals no longer commit crime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Non-perforce criminals</em> commit crime for anything else. Examples are psychopaths (people with physical inability to weigh bad consequences because their brains are wired differently). The solution is unbreeding: modify them by gene therapy or psychological therapy or whatever technology, or kill them if they can't change, but only after we have proven that they can't change.</p>
<ul>
<li>See also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/">theatlantic.com: When your child is a psychopath</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prisons should not exist. There should exist only two kinds of punishment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced labor, for perforce criminals, to repair the harm they did. The state must also help them reintegrate into society.</li>
<li>Death penalty, for non-perforce criminals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In any case, nobody should be locked up for so long. Locking up people wastes resource.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>A government is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>do things that benefit many but do not benefit a few, such as building roads;</li>
<li>prevent things that benefit few but do not benefit many, such as committing crime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A government is to minimize negative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externality</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a>.</li>
<li><p>A government is to prevent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ungrouped-content"><span class="section_number">16.5</span><span class="section_title">Ungrouped content</span></h3>
<p>A modern government is designed to minimize the damage if a bad person rises to the top, not to maximize the benefit if a good person rises to the top. That is why a republic has checks and balances. The most efficient government is a benevolent competent dictator, but does such person exist?</p>
<p>The government is a monopoly, and it should seek profit for its stakeholders: all its people. Government official corruption, similar to corporate management corruption, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal-agent problem</a>. Everything that solves the principal-agent problem also solves corruption.</p>
<h3 id="deciding-what-governments-should-do"><span class="section_number">16.6</span><span class="section_title">Deciding what governments should do</span></h3>
<p>Use this quadrant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axis 1: Does it benefit many people?</li>
<li>Axis 2: Does it benefit a few people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that benefit many and benefit few are best left to the private sector with as little regulation as needed to keep the market healthy.</p>
<p>Things that benefit many but disadvantage few should be done by the public sector, because the private sector will not do them because they don't get money doing that. Example: building road.</p>
<p>Things that disadvantage many but benefit few should be prevented by the government. Example: rent-seeking (bribing, lobbying, speculation of non-fungible goods such as land parcels and Internet domain names), crime, terrorism.</p>
<p>Things that disadvantage many and disadvantage few should also be discouraged by the government. Example: road rage, human stupidity.</p>
<h3 id="tips-from-our-ancestors"><span class="section_number">16.7</span><span class="section_title">Tips from our ancestors</span></h3>
<p>I do not always agree with Lenin, but I agree with this sentence of his:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it is not immediately apparent which political or social groups, forces or alignments advocate certain proposals, measures, etc., one should always ask: &quot;Who stands to gain?&quot;</p>
<p>Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov a.k.a. Lenin (1870–1924) (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/apr/11.htm">source</a>)</p>
