<h3 id="focusing-on-growth-instead-of-sustainability"><span class="section_number">2.1</span><span class="section_title">Focusing on growth instead of sustainability</span></h3>
<p>Economic growth is not a worthy goal.</p>
<h3 id="is-financial-investing-moral"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">Is financial investing moral?</span></h3>
<p>Financial investing is getting more money without doing anything. It is immoral, because it means indirectly stealing a little from everyone else. We should not glorify rentiers, freeloaders, and thiefs.</p>
<p>But does that mean that passive income, rent, interest, tax, pension fund, and royalty are immoral?</p>
<p>Both inflation and deflation are immoral, because it betrays everyone who trusts the currency. Inflation hurts buyers. Deflation hurts sellers.</p>
<p>But inflation prevents currency hoarding.</p>
<h3 id="taxation-capitalism-stealing-from-the-thieves"><span class="section_number">2.3</span><span class="section_title">Taxation + capitalism = stealing from the thieves</span></h3>
<p>Taxing the capitalists is stealing from the thieves. Both taxation and capitalism are immoral. Their combination is unnecessarily convoluted. The correct solution is to not have any theft in the first place.</p>
<p>The solution is not taxing the rich. The solution is to remove the law that enables the creation of power-centralizing entities. People must unite but they must not form a formal union.</p>
<p>Examples of power-centralizing entities are formal institutions, formal organizations, companies, formal labor unions, legal fictions, virtual people.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-still-care-about-constitutions"><span class="section_number">2.4</span><span class="section_title">Why do we still care about constitutions?</span></h3>
<p>Why should people in the 21st century agree with people in the 18th century? Why should we agree with people born 300 years ago? We don't even agree with our parents born 30 years ago!</p>
<p>What is a constitution?</p>
<p>USSR 1936 under Stalin<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> had the most beautiful-sounding constitution, but it was only a lip service; the practice was nowhere near that. The most important thing a constitution must have is <em>limitation and decentralization</em> of power.</p>
<h3 id="inequality-is-a-symptom-not-the-disease"><span class="section_number">2.5</span><span class="section_title">Inequality is a symptom, not the disease</span></h3>
<p>Life is never fair. Nobody chooses to be born.</p>
<p>Freedom is more desirable than equality. We cannot have both total freedom and total equality.</p>
<p>Inequality is a symptom, not the disease. All these people calling for equality are misguided. They should be calling for freedom and power distribution.</p>
<p>The disease is power centralization.</p>
<h3 id="competition-is-wasteful-engineers-should-be-a-hive-mind-and-not-enclaves"><span class="section_number">2.6</span><span class="section_title">Competition is wasteful; engineers should be a hive mind and not enclaves</span></h3>
<p>Global engineering hive mind is more efficient for humanity than engineering enclaves.</p>
<p>Engineers in competing companies duplicate each other's work all the time.</p>
<p>This is a massive planet-scale waste of human mind power.</p>
<p>Companies and organizations must be abolished and replaced with global anarcho-syndicalistic hive mind in which no one person has too much power.</p>

<p>The problem is not capitalism vs Stalinism. The problem is <em>centralization of power</em>. Both USA and USSR are corrupt. USA gives too much power to companies. USSR gives too much power to Stalin.</p>
<p>Both a state and a company are legal fictions for centralizing powers.</p>
<p>Stanford prison experiment<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> shows that <em>power corrupts</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> good people.</p>
<p>Dacher Keltner has done some research on the effects of power on nice people. Power &quot;has a disinhibiting effect regarding the social consequences of exercising it&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Power centralization is a logical consequence of our systems. It means that the systems are working as designed.</p>
<p>Our systems have a tendency to centralize power. Property. Capitalism. These tend to centralize power.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="what-is-a-state"><span class="section_number">4.1</span><span class="section_title">What is a state?</span></h3>
<p>A state is essentially a massive principal-agent problem<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> involving millions of people.</p>
<p>The people give up their monopoly of violence to the state, and the state promises to do good to the people. The problem is principal-agent problem. The state cannot be trusted.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-workers-empower-themselves"><span class="section_number">4.2</span><span class="section_title">How can workers empower themselves?</span></h3>
<p>Labor laws and unions are the wrong solution. The correct solution is that the workers must unite and think for themselves, but they must not form a union. Once a union is formed (as a legal entity), it has a life of its own, and the principal-agent problem begins. There is always room and incentive for union bosses to collude with the original enemy, enrich themselves, and betray the original electors. The anarcho-syndicalists get this mostly right (what they get wrong is &quot;revolution&quot;).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Direct action.</p>
<h3 id="what-benefits-us-is-trade-not-capitalism"><span class="section_number">4.3</span><span class="section_title">What benefits us is trade, not capitalism</span></h3>
<p>Capitalism contains free trade. Free trade benefits everybody, but the for-profit private ownership of property doesn't always benefit everybody. By free trade, we mean voluntary exchanges/transactions.</p>
<p>It is possible to have free trade without capitalism. Anarchy is an example.</p>
<p>The issue is centralization of power. Companies centralize economic power. States centralize political power. Institutions/organizations centralize power. People must unite, but they must not form unions. Principal-agent problem. Unions have lives of their own.</p>
<h3 id="capitalism-has-nothing-to-do-with-free-trade"><span class="section_number">4.4</span><span class="section_title">Capitalism has nothing to do with free trade?</span></h3>
<p>Capitalism is simply the private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Capitalism places capital above labor. Nature places labor above capital: Someone somewhere eventually has to <em>actually do</em> something in order to produce something. <em>Labor is more important than capital.</em> Capitalism goes against nature? Capital without labor will not produce anything. Labor without capital is merely inefficiently allocated.</p>
<p>Capitalism (market?) is a voting about what we should use labor for?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Change the justice system from retributive justice to restorative justice for the non-violent criminals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of locking up prisoners, let them repair the harm they did, and help them reintegrate into society.</li>
<li><p>Millions of people are being incarcerated. Their ability is being wasted. They are deprived of future. They will have difficulties reintegrating into society. Stigmatized. Like the homeless. This stigma makes it impossible for them to get financial stability and get out of the vicious circle of crime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, prison initiation rituals are terrible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are two kinds of criminals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Perforce criminals</em> commit crime to defend themselves from immediate bodily harm that threatens their existence. Examples are hungry moneyless people who steal food, and cornered people who kill. The solution is restorative justice, and giving work to the criminal for financial stability, helping them reintegrate into society.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the threat is removed, perforce criminals no longer commit crime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Non-perforce criminals</em> commit crime for anything else. Examples are psychopaths (people with physical inability to weigh bad consequences because their brains are wired differently). The solution is unbreeding: modify them by gene therapy or psychological therapy or whatever technology, or kill them if they can't change, but only after we have proven that they can't change.</p>
<ul>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prisons should not exist. There should exist only two kinds of punishment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced labor, for perforce criminals, to repair the harm they did. The state must also help them reintegrate into society.</li>
<li>Death penalty, for non-perforce criminals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In any case, nobody should be locked up for so long. Locking up people wastes resource.</p></li>

<p>A modern government is designed to minimize the damage if a bad person rises to the top, not to maximize the benefit if a good person rises to the top. That is why a republic has checks and balances. The most efficient government is a benevolent competent dictator, but does such person exist?</p>
<p>The government is a monopoly, and it should seek profit for its stakeholders: all its people. Government official corruption, similar to corporate management corruption, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">principal-agent problem</a>. Everything that solves the principal-agent problem also solves corruption.</p>
<h3 id="deciding-what-governments-should-do"><span class="section_number">5.7</span><span class="section_title">Deciding what governments should do</span></h3>
<p>Use this quadrant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Axis 1: Does it benefit many people?</li>
<li>Axis 2: Does it benefit a few people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that benefit many and benefit few are best left to the private sector with as little regulation as needed to keep the market healthy.</p>
<p>Things that benefit many but disadvantage few should be done by the public sector, because the private sector will not do them because they don't get money doing that. Example: building road.</p>
<p>Things that disadvantage many but benefit few should be prevented by the government. Example: rent-seeking (bribing, lobbying, speculation of non-fungible goods such as land parcels and Internet domain names), crime, terrorism.</p>
<p>Things that disadvantage many and disadvantage few should also be discouraged by the government. Example: road rage, human stupidity.</p>

<p>I do not always agree with Lenin, but I agree with this sentence of his:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it is not immediately apparent which political or social groups, forces or alignments advocate certain proposals, measures, etc., one should always ask: &quot;Who stands to gain?&quot;</p>
<p>Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov a.k.a. Lenin (1870–1924) (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/apr/11.htm">source</a>)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>1h: Specify desired features and differences from mainstream browsers</p>
<p>Principle: the user should have maximum control.</p>
<p>It is not only a browser. It is a tool for controlling your web experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser is distributed/P2P.</li>
<li>The browser comes with a search engine that searches your public history or your peers' public history, and distribute indexes to peers.</li>
<li>Block all ads because advertising depends on making people addicted.</li>
<li>Block all popups, no exception, no clickjacking.</li>
<li>Block all &quot;soft-popups&quot; (displays).</li>
<li>Run user script for certain websites.</li>
<li>Block all cookies by default.</li>
<li>Don't load JavaScript by default.</li>
<li>Don't load images by default.</li>
<li>Apply default CSS. Don't load CSS by default.</li>
<li>Enable user-agent spoofing.</li>
<li>For advanced users. No GUI to configure. Write Prolog code to configure the browser.</li>
<li>Default to HTTPS when protocol is not given.</li>
<li>No download manager. Tell the user to use wget, curl, or whatever.</li>
<li>Like emacs but:
<ul>
<li>browser instead of text editor</li>
<li>prolog instead of emacs lisp</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Browser must limit memory usage. See entity explosion problem.</li>
<li>Browser should refuse to load HTML documents larger than 1 MB.</li>
<li>User can easily change user agent. WhatsApp wrong browser detection.</li>
<li>combine with caching, peer-to-peer caching, distributed (and social?) searching and ranking and sharing, but what about privacy and the people who try to game the system?</li>
<li>Don't remember tabs when closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limit open tabs to 10. Discourage context-switching. I'm a pathological tab hoarder. Always open a configurable set of tabs on start. If you need to open more tabs, then open a google docs or a note-taking app instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a fast, private, and secure web browser in Prolog.

<p>Thesis: We should let someone do whatever he/she wants to do as long as he/she doesn't harm others, even if it makes him/her personally worse off.</p>
<p>Now the problem.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't parents let children do what children want as long as children don't harm others? Why do we let an adult smoke cigarette, but we don't let a child smoke cigarette? Why should we prevent children from touching wall sockets, drinking bleaches, and doing other dangerous things? Why should we prevent children from harming themselves? Libertarians are forced to conclude that children aren't people. This conclusion is not inherently bad. We can also define peopleness as a continuum (children are 50% people, for example).</p>
<p>Why should we vaccinate children?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Libertarianism-When-do-children-own-themselves-if-at-all">https://www.quora.com/Libertarianism-When-do-children-own-themselves-if-at-all</a></p>
<p>However, an antinatalist libertarian wouldn't have this problem, because having children would be immoral in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/6356ym/shouldnt_libertarians_be_anti_natalist/">https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/6356ym/shouldnt_libertarians_be_anti_natalist/</a></p>
<p>Our language implies that children aren't people.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the pronoun &quot;it&quot; to refer to a child.</li>
<li>Casualty count (death toll) is categorized into &quot;men&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, and &quot;children&quot;.</li>
<li>We sometimes use the phrase &quot;men, women, and children&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is in the language. &quot;Person&quot; is not a binary concept; it's a continuum. A child may be 20% personlike. The more personlike something is, the more we should treat it as a person.</p>

<p>While in government hands, British Petroleum paid too little attention to profitability, constrained by its need to please elected officials who often cared more about keeping energy cheap and employment high. But in private hands, it may have cared about profits far too much, at the expense of other objectives. “BP veered from being a company that made sure nothing blew up to one focusing on cost-cutting at all costs,” Professor Fisman said. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/when-privatization-works-and-why-it-doesnt-always.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/when-privatization-works-and-why-it-doesnt-always.html</a></p>

<p>The best thing for a person to do is what he/she <em>voluntarily</em> does?</p>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people don't know what they want?</li>

<h4 id="institutions"><span class="section_number">5.13.2</span><span class="section_title">Institutions?</span></h4>
<p>What is an institution? Government bodies? Governing bodies?</p>
<p>Do we need institutions?</p>
<p>Why do we lose trust in institutions?</p>
<p>Institutions enable people to hide. Institutions enable people to abuse power without being held responsible. Institutions deflect blame from people to an abstract entity. Institutions separate the powerful from the coerced. People should be responsible. Instutitions cannot be responsible.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats cannot see reality from their desks alone.</p>

<p>The most ideal society so far seems to be John Rawls's ideal society (based on his theory of social justice and veil of ignorance).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> What are the problems?</p>

<p>Every man has his own wants.</p>
<p>A voluntary trade betters all parties. But why stop at trade? A voluntary life betters the person.</p>
<p>The ideal society maximizes individual freedom while minimizing harm to the species. Maximizes volition, the will to live. Everyone fearlessly does what they love most. Nobody slaves away at the office.</p>
<p>Occasional inconsequential broken small promises are okay. People change. People are sometimes too optimistic.</p>

<p>We must not assume that everyone is good.</p>
<p>Axiom: bad people always beat good people.</p>

<p>An animal kills only when it is hungry or threatened. A lion with full stomach does not kill a deer. An animal does not kill more than it eats. A lion does not kill two deers if eating one deer suffices to fill up its stomach. The surviving deers do not hold grudges against the lions. The deers do not plot a retaliatory genocide of the lions.</p>
<p>But the more intelligent animals do hold grudges.</p>
<p>A human may kill for fun out of boredom, or out of envy, or other excuses.</p>

<h4 id="statistics-makes-bullshit-appear-legitimate"><span class="section_number">9.2.1</span><span class="section_title">Statistics makes bullshit appear legitimate</span></h4>
<p>In 2019, by refuting a bullshit in Gamal Albinsaid's Twitter account, Ainun Najib demonstrates<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Brandolini's bullshit asymmetry principle<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>: &quot;the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it&quot;.</p>
<p>One does not have to understand statistics in order to be able to bullshit with statistics.</p>
<p>Most people (including myself) don't understand statistics.</p>
<p>Every time I see an article with statistics, I suspect that the author has not done sufficient philosophical analysis.</p>
<p>We do not have to refute the entire bullshit. We only have to point out a fatal flaw, such as a truncated graph, and cause readers to doubt the writer's intention.</p>
<p>A bullshit contains the necessary ingredient to refute itself. A bullshit has an inherent flaw that we can point out without referring to anything outside the bullshit. We just have to point it out. &quot;This is a truncated graph. You are lying.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="levels-of-lying"><span class="section_number">9.2.2</span><span class="section_title">Levels of lying?</span></h4>
<p>Level 0: obvious lie, obviously nonsensical, takes no effort to refute. Example: a child who broke a vase.</p>
<p>Level 1: sophisticated story, but no data.</p>
<p>Level 2: using true data, but selecting only the data that matches your agenda.</p>
<p>Level 3: level 2 plus fancy graphics, numbers, tables, statistics, truncated graphs<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>, and damn lies<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Level 4: level 3 plus creating your own pseudo-philosophy.</p>
<p>Level 5: post-truth politics: inventing your own facts.</p>

<h4 id="purpose"><span class="section_number">9.3.1</span><span class="section_title">Purpose</span></h4>
<p>The highest law is the will of the people. The people can change the constitution.</p>

<p>Economically, government is to maximize positive externality, and minimize negative externality.</p>
<p>Example negative externality: road congestion due to residential space transforming to commercial space.</p>
<h4 id="policy"><span class="section_number">9.3.2</span><span class="section_title">Policy</span></h4>
<p>Do the simplest intervention with the least effort, the greatest effect, the least gameability, the least unintended consequences. But those are conflicting requirements.</p>
<p>Example: even-odd license plate based on day of month. People will game this by buying two license plates or buying two vehicles.</p>
<p>Avoid wasting resources on policies that do not attack the root cause of the problem.</p>
<h4 id="murder"><span class="section_number">9.3.3</span><span class="section_title">Murder</span></h4>
<p>Why is something illegal? Perpetrators are going to perpetrate anyway, and non-perpetrators are not going to perpetrate, regardless of its illegality.</p>
<p>Some people commit crime unwillingly because they want to continue living but they no see other way. Some people are wired differently and commit crime like a pastime.</p>
<p>If something is illegal, why does a perpetrator still do it? Is it futile to make anything illegal? If it were not illegal, will it still be done?</p>
<p>Law cannot change human nature. If you want to change human nature, study biology, not law. Lawmaking must defer to human nature.</p>
<p>It is impossible to enforce a law if millions of people violate it at the same time. If a law is against human nature, of course people will violate it.</p>
<p>Is it moral to force someone who enjoy murder not to murder?</p>
<h4 id="morality"><span class="section_number">9.3.4</span><span class="section_title">Morality</span></h4>
<p>Government should not interfere in private matter such as religion, insurance, and consensual sex.</p>
<p>If something does not harm anyone else other than the doer, it should not be illegal.</p>
<p>We should help others, but we should to the greatest extent avoid forcing others to do anything against their will even though doing that would be good for them. Consequence: procreation is immoral because it forces people to exist without their consent.</p>
<p>We can persuade, but we should not force, unless we are in war.</p>
<p>Consumption should be taxed, not income.</p>
<p>Alternative to taxation: donation, state-owned enterprise.</p>
<p>Stability.</p>
<p>In a republic, in an election, you don't pick the best candidate; you pick the one that will do the least damage.</p>
<p>Holding a government position should not be profitable. How do we prevent abuse of power? By not giving power in the first place? The people must have the final say.</p>
<h4 id="banning"><span class="section_number">9.3.5</span><span class="section_title">Banning</span></h4>
<p>Banning something does not eliminate it. Worse, banning it may also create a black market for it.</p>
<p>Regulate, don't ban.</p>
<h4 id="sex"><span class="section_number">9.3.6</span><span class="section_title">Sex</span></h4>
<p>Blocking access to Internet porn sites does not work.</p>
<p>Banning prostitution creates black market.</p>
<p>Banning sex makes more people more curious.</p>
<p>It's part of human nature.</p>
<p>Family education.</p>
<h4 id="drugs"><span class="section_number">9.3.7</span><span class="section_title">Drugs</span></h4>
<p>Some people are curious.</p>
<h4 id="patents"><span class="section_number">9.3.8</span><span class="section_title">Patents</span></h4>
<p>Alternative to patents: Prize system: People collect money for a problem, and the sum is awarded to the inventors who solve the problem.</p>
<p>Another alternative: People can donate to inventors.</p>
<p>Another alternative: Assume that inventors do things because they love to do that, and they want money, but don't want to get filthy rich.</p>
<p>How was the first people who invented spears rewarded, if they were rewarded at all?</p>
<h4 id="prevention-of-mass-destruction"><span class="section_number">9.3.9</span><span class="section_title">Prevention of mass destruction</span></h4>
<p>How does a government prevent nuclear briefcase detonation, water source poisoning, asteroids hitting Earth, and so on?</p>
<p>The amount of security is inversely proportional to the amount of trust. If you could trust everybody, security would be unnecessary. Republics are complicated because you can't trust the ruler. Republics are designed to minimize the damage done by an evil ruler, not to maximize the benefit done by a competent ruler.</p>
<p>The most efficient government is benevolent competent kind laissez-faire minimalist absolute monarch, but it is also the most risky. Anything can happen if the ruler dies.</p>
<h4 id="differences"><span class="section_number">9.3.10</span><span class="section_title">Differences</span></h4>
<p>Conventional government assumes that most humans are fundamentally evil. New government assumes that most humans are fundamentally non-evil.</p>
<h4 id="office"><span class="section_number">9.3.11</span><span class="section_title">Office</span></h4>
<p>If you tell people to do something they don't want, they will do their best to avoid it. If they want to do it, they will do it anyway without your telling them. Thus, you don't tell people. You simply let them do things, help them do things, get out of their way.</p>
<p>If you hire the people who don't want to do the things you want, no amount of salary will fix it. When you hire people, there is an intersection between what they want, what you want, and what your organization wants.</p>
<p>In the office, there are so many things happening that it is too much for one person to keep track what everyone else is doing. You are the only person who knows what you really do. Your supervisor, if any, is the second person to know what you do. Others have even vaguer ideas about what you do. But people can instinctively see whether you're doing well or not, so if you're not doing well, you must pretend that you were doing well, and then suddenly you will do well. If you think you're not doing well, if you doubt yourself, then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if you are absolutely sure that your job is unimportant, even if you keep stumbling, you must unquestioningly believe that you are doing well.</p>
<p>In the office, what you do is less important than what others think you do.</p>
<p>If you don't know what to do, walk around, and talk to people.</p>
<p>If you don't fit in one company, maybe that's the company's fault. But if you have tried three much-different companies and still can't fit, maybe it's your fault.</p>
<p>Make friends. People first. Jobs second.</p>
<p>The number of processes is inversely proportional to the amount of trust.</p>
<p>How much trust are you convenient with?</p>
<p>There are people you naturally gravitate towards, and people you naturally gravitate away from.</p>

<p>How one becomes a fascist: He feels that democracy goes nowhere. He realizes that people don't change. People don't care. Politicians are corrupt. Government doesn't help him. Cities are unwalkable. He feels the system is rigged against him. He begins isolating himself. He continues to think. As he thinks, he becomes more extreme. He reinforces his beliefs. He confirms his own biases. He goes online. He meets people who feel the same. He is young and impatient. He wants to see changes right now.</p>

<h4 id="marriage-regulates-copulation-not-procreation"><span class="section_number">9.15.1</span><span class="section_title">Marriage regulates copulation, not procreation</span></h4>
<p>Marriage regulates <em>copulation</em> (having sex), not procreation (having offsprings).</p>
<p><em>Before</em> marriage has been invented, the society assumes that copulation is allowed by default unless explicitly forbidden (by complaints, disputes, fights, wars, treaties, etc.). <em>After</em> marriage has been invented, the society assumes that copulation is forbidden by default unless explicitly allowed (by marriage). This change of fundamental assumption improves public order.</p>
<p>Copulation and procreation are two <em>orthogonal</em> concepts. Two concepts are orthogonal if we can have one without the other, in both ways.</p>
<p>To <em>copulate</em> is to link / join / bind / tie / couple / bring together / conjoin (the genitals). To copulate is to cause the male genital to be inside the female genital. The male genital protrudes (goes outward). The female genital receives (goes inward).</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copula#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copula#Latin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Copulation is sexual intercourse. Procreation is the production of offspring.</p>
<p>We can have <em>copulation without procreation</em>: inserting the penis into the vagina without ejaculating sperm, even between two married people.</p>
<p>We can have <em>procreation without copulation</em>: cloning, in-vitro fertilization, synthetic organisms.</p>
<p>Marriage is about exclusive copulation, not about procreation.</p>
<h4 id="arguments-for-and-against-generalizing-marriage"><span class="section_number">9.15.2</span><span class="section_title">Arguments for and against generalizing marriage</span></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Pro: Marriage regulates copulation, not procreation</p>
<p>Do you mind if your spouse copulate with but doesn't procreate with someone else? That is, do you mind if your spouse had sex with someone else as long as nobody gets pregnant? If you do mind that, then marriage is about regulating copulation, not procreation.</p>
<p>Do you mind if you can procreate with but not copulate with your spouse? Consider an average couple. Suppose that the husband's penis and the wife's vagina must never touch, but a third person will, at no cost to the couple, inject the husband's sperm into the wife so that the couple can have a child. Do the average husband and wife mind such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexless_marriage">sexless marriage</a>? If they do, then marriage is about regulating copulation, not procreation.</p>
<p>Marriage, public order, and justification of marriage?</p>
<p>Legally, marriage exists to maintain public order. Biologically, public order exists to maintain survival of the species.</p>
<p>Why does marriage exist?</p>
<p>Marriage exists because the average person gets angry when someone (s)he copulated with copulated with someone else, and this anger may disturb public order. Problem: The definition seems to require that the sexes be different. Is it reasonable to generalize &quot;copulation&quot; into &quot;any sexual act&quot;?</p>
<p>The average person would be angry if his/her spouse have any sexual acts (including flirting and sexual advances) with someone else. It is not only copulation. It is all sexual acts. It is all acts that may reduce the chance of copulation. The average man would be suspicious if his wife begins receiving lavish gifts from another man.</p>
<p>Therefore it is reasonable to generalize marriages to concern the exclusive rights of everything that may lead into copulation, not only copulation.</p>
<p>The debate of marriages boil down to the definition of copulation, and the relationship between copulation and procreation.</p>
<p>Originally copulation was for procreation/reproduction, but then nervous systems evolved, then pleasure centers evolved, and thus copulation evolves to be pleasurable, because otherwise the organism will not reproduce.</p></li>
<li><p>Con: Monogamy has evolutionary benefits</p>
<p>Perhaps most of us we have evolved to prefer monogamy.</p>
<p>Monogamy reduces the risk of contracting sexually-transmitted diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those diseases may co-evolve with us.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/15/203695">Sexual conflict and STDs: coevolution of sexually antagonistic host traits with a sexually transmitted disease | bioRxiv</a></li>

<h4 id="general-marriage"><span class="section_number">9.15.3</span><span class="section_title">General marriage</span></h4>
<p>Contract law subsumes marriage law. The law does not need to define marriages, because ordinary contract law suffices. We can restate marriage terms in <em>contract law terms</em>: cheating is <em>breach</em>, divorce is <em>termination</em>, and alimony is <em>damages</em>.</p>
<p>Usually we think that a marriage is a <em>contract</em> between a person X, a person Y, and their society, stating that:</p>
<ul>
<li>person X and person Y may copulate with each other,</li>
<li>person X must not copulate with anyone else other than person Y,</li>
<li>person Y must not copulate with anyone else other than person X,</li>
<li>the society will help enforce that restriction.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that thinking is too narrow. We can generalize that definition to any arrangement of sexual rights. Two aspects of marriage generalize readily: the <em>number</em>, from only two to any number; and the <em>kinds</em> of allowed sexual activities, from only copulation to any kind of sexual activities. For example, group marriage generalizes the number, and gay marriage generalizes the kind of sexual activities.</p>
<p>Some examples of generalized marriages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group marriage involving a group G of people P1, …, Pn:
<ul>
<li>If person X is in G and person Y is in G, then person X and person Y may copulate.</li>
<li>Everyone in G must not copulate with anyone outside G.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strictly-heterosexual group marriage:
<ul>
<li>Each person X in group G may copulate with each person Y in G if X and Y have different sexes.</li>
<li>Everything else is forbidden.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>General marriage:
<ul>
<li>A marriage is an undirected graph.</li>
<li>An edge (x,y) means that x may copulate with y.</li>
<li>The absence of an edge (x,y) means that x must not copulate with y.</li>
<li>You can see where this is going: complete-graph marriage, point-to-point marriage, bus marriage, star marriage, ring marriage, mesh marriage, daisy-chain marriage, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology#Classification">other topologies</a> of marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We can even have directed graphs. For example, X may penetrate Y, but Y must not penetrate X.</p>
<p>We can even have multigraphs. We can explicitly list the permitted sexual activities in the contract.</p>
<p>Marriage law is redundant.</p>
<p>Marriage is just a contract that happens to be about sexual rights.</p>
<p>Marriage is about regulating the genitals, not about regulating procreation. When people fuck, they don't think about the next 20 years. They just want to enjoy the moment.</p>
<p>Relationship between marriage, graph theory, and model theory: What is the shortest first-order logic formula that describes a graph that describes a marriage?</p>

<p>Potential is what may be.</p>
<p><em>Waste</em> is failure to actualize potential. Failure is final and irreversible.</p>
<p>The goal of a state is to ensure freedom for each person to actualize his/her potential, pursue greatness</p>
<p>Why do we feel bad wasting?</p>
<h3 id="anti-natalists-are-the-true-liberals"><span class="section_number">9.17</span><span class="section_title">Anti-natalists are the true liberals</span></h3>
<p>A liberal is a person who avoids forcing other people.</p>
<p>Anti-natalism is a logical consequence of liberalism. It is the ultimate respect for life. It is the maximum amount of respect we can give to sentient beings: We let them freely choose which one they want: existence or non-existence.</p>
<p>Natalists force other people to exist. This goes against liberal morality.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-land-so-expensive"><span class="section_number">9.18</span><span class="section_title">Why is land so expensive?</span></h3>
<p>Why is land so expensive?</p>
<p>Because sellers are asking for a high price.</p>
<p>How much did they buy it for?</p>
<p>Multiply the price by 70%-90%, for each year they own that land.</p>
<p>Why are buyers willing to pay such high price?</p>
<p>Because they can still squeeze some profit from the next people despite such high rent.</p>
<p>Land owners squeeze the land buyers who then squeeze the property users who then squeeze the customers.</p>
<p>Why does land price keep increasing? Wrong question. Why does <em>some</em> land price keep increasing? A land in the middle of nowhere does not change price much.</p>

<p>Seemingly immoral things are often moral when they are done <em>for defense</em>.</p>
<p>Thus we can justify killing people by <em>framing it as defense</em>. If they are the first to try to kill us, then it is moral to defend ourselves by killing them.</p>
<p>People who believe that they are being attacked will feel fine killing their attackers. Thus the trick to make people attack X is to make them believe that they are being attacked by X.</p>
<p>When convincing people, the truth is not important, because nobody knows the truth. What is important is believability. Some people are predisposed to have certain beliefs. Also, beliefs are contagious. Stupidity is contagious.</p>
<p>Anger tempts us to act. Whether we actually act depends on whether our anger exceeds our fear.</p>

            Disqus has been removed because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
            On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website are broken,
            and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.

                    Or, even better, contribute to a community wiki.
