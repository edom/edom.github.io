<p>Trust is the assumption that others will not exploit our vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Everything is vulnerable. Vulnerabilities differ in their probability and the severity, and thus their expected damages. We protect our houses with gates to deter thieves. But we don't protect our houses against meteors. Meteors do more damage than thieves, but meteors are so rare that the expected damage of thieves exceeds the expected damage of meteors. We probabilistically reason that thieves are more risky than meteors.</p>

<p>If I ask you to wave your hand, will you do that? By following what I tell you, you have given me some power over you. Why do you give me power? Why do you let me control?</p>
<p>If I ask you to bark like a dog for $10, will you do that?</p>
<p>If I ask you to dig coal for $50,000 a year, will you do that? If I ask you to drill the Earth for oil for $50,000 a year, will you do that? What if I give you more money?</p>
<p>If I ask you to cut down a forest for $50,000 a year, will you do that? Somebody out there will do that.</p>
<p>You see, there is a common theme: you <em>let</em> others tell you what to do.</p>
<p>Rich people can only give you money. They don't cut down the trees themselves.</p>
<p>Why do we let others tell us what to do? Because they pay?</p>
<p>Why do we let money bend our will?</p>
<h4 id="what-is-power"><span class="section_number">1.3.2</span><span class="section_title">What is power?</span></h4>
<p>Power is control.</p>
<p>The amount of power X has over Y is the amount of control X has over Y.</p>
<p>Power is the ability to harm.</p>
<p>Power is the potential to do violence.</p>
<p>To have power is to control. We say that <em>X has power over Y</em> to mean <em>X controls Y</em>.</p>
<h4 id="why-distribute-power"><span class="section_number">1.3.3</span><span class="section_title">Why distribute power?</span></h4>
<p>Keltner's paradox of power is a strong scientific reason for distributing power.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Feeling powerful reduces morality and inhibition.</p>
<p>Feeling powerless causes chronic stress.</p>

<p>By gaining trust.</p>
<p>X can have power over Y if and only if Y <em>lets</em> X have power over Y.</p>
<p>Employers control employees because employees <em>let</em> employers.</p>
<p>Government controls the governed because the governed <em>let</em> the government.</p>
<p>Gain power by sharing it?<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Now we understand where power comes from. Evil people have power because we <em>let</em> them. How do we let them?</p>
<p>By being employed by them to perpetuate their evil. Rich people are not destroying the environment. <em>We</em>, their employees, are destroying the environment, by doing what they want us to do. We, the coal miners. We, the power plant operators. We, the car sellers. <em>We are complicit</em>. We <em>let</em> them control us. It is our hands, the workers' hands, not the rich people's hands, who murder the kids, who launches the missiles.</p>
<p><em>All rich people can do is give us money.</em> If we accept that money and we do evil, then we ourselves are at fault.</p>
<p>Companies and rich people are not to blame. We the complicit majority are to be blame. We are sleepwalking. We are not aware of our own power. We have power but we are afraid to use it.</p>
<p>But even if we are not complicit, those rich people will just buy machines and destroy the environment anyway? Therefore they are truly immoral? Why do they take pride in short-term profit maximization? Who taught them?</p>
<p>Government must come from the people. US government is for the rich only, not for the people. The candidates are rich people. The government listens only to rich people. The government does what is good for rich people. There is never a grassroot candidate.</p>
<p>But we have to feed our families. Where do we get money? This is the wrong question. The question is: How do we feed our families? <em>We</em> can farm ourselves. We feed them directly from our own labor. Nature always gives to those who work, to those who hunt, gather, or farm. Nature does not discriminate. Only in nature, those who do not work do not eat. A seed does not care about the color of the hand that sows it.</p>
<h4 id="where-does-one-get-power"><span class="section_number">1.3.7</span><span class="section_title">Where does one get power?</span></h4>
<p>From nature. Some of us grow to be strong and healthy people, by virtue of good genetics, good habit, and good nourishment.</p>

<p>Did Warren Buffett say that risk comes from not understanding what we are doing?</p>
<p>Risk comes from Italian &quot;riscare&quot; which means &quot;to run into danger&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Risk is danger.</p>
<p>Danger is something that may harm.</p>
<p>Risk has negative connotation.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-hazard"><span class="section_number">1.4.2</span><span class="section_title">What is hazard?</span></h4>
<p>&quot;Hazard&quot; was the name of a game of chance played with dice<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. In 2019, &quot;hazard&quot; means danger.</p>

<p>Insurance buyers hope to never have to use it, because having to use it means shit has happened. We hope that shit doesn't happen. When you buy a scissor, you expect to use it. Insurance is the only thing that you buy but hope to never have to use it.</p>
<p>If I buy a gun, I hope to never have to use it.</p>
<p>If I buy a fire extinguisher, I hope to never have to use it. Is it absurd for me to buy a fire extinguisher?</p>
<p>We hope that we never have to use atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Having to use an insurance or a gun means that something bad has happened. We don't want bad things to happen.</p>

<p>Signing a contract that obliges you is trusting.</p>
<p>Signing a contract that gives you a right is distrusting.</p>
<p>We make a contract because we want the state to help us when the other party breaches the contract. Thus we make a contract because we distrust the other party.</p>
<p>Contracts reduces the amount of trust required for trade.</p>
<p>If the state did not exist, would we still make contracts? We would rely on honor, and not the state.</p>
<p>But underlying every contract is the assumption that the state is honorable.</p>
<p>Contract assumes a third-party enforcer that is powerful and honorable (just, fair, neutral, reliable).</p>

<p>&quot;Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom,[97] and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>That sounds very much like the relationship between a lessee (tenant/renter) and a lessor (landlord). A lessee practically will never have enough money to buy the lessor's property; the economic system guarantees that. For example, in 2019, my neighbor is asking IDR 3 billion for his 72-m2 land and house on it. A typical frugal man who saves IDR 3 million monthly salary will need to save for 83 years, assuming over-optimistically zero inflation. He would have died 20 years before he had saved enough to buy the house!</p>
<p>In principle slavery has been abolished, but in practice the economic system guarantees that most people will forever live mediocre lives, although in much better condition than that of ancient Roman slaves. But we can do better.</p>

<p>Food has been the best-selling thing for 40,000 years, but why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?</p>
<p>Here's a thought experiment that leads me to that question.</p>
<p>Imagine an economy that consists of 1 extremely frugal farmer and 1 doctor. After some time, money accumulates at the farmer, because the doctor always needs to eat, but the farmer doesn't always have a health problem.</p>
<p>A government has these options, from the least coercive to the most coercive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing, and hope that the farmer donates his money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Create more money and give it to the doctor. But the farmer may think that this is unfair.</li>
<li>Tax the farmer and give that tax money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Force the farmer to spend his money on the doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current economic system suffers from money accumulation.</p>
<p>Is accumulation of money bad? Is inequality bad?</p>

<p>Employment is subjugation. X employs Y because X has a better idea about what Y should do with Y's time in order to make more profits for X.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-work-without-employment"><span class="section_number">2.3.3</span><span class="section_title">What is work without employment?</span></h4>
<p>Work without subjugation. Work without power asymmetry.</p>
<p>Work gives life meaning. We like work and dislike employment. We want a world in which we work because we want to, not because we have to.</p>
<p>What is work? Work is purposeful deed/action. The difference between work and leisure is teleological. What is employment?</p>
<p>Life <em>is</em> work. Your work defines you. You are only as good as your contribution to the world. Your work defines the meaning of your life.</p>
<p>Don't confuse working with employment. Work is everything that creates value. Employment is subjugation.</p>

<p>My guess of division of labor in stone age: Able men and childless women find food. Women and old men raise children.</p>
<p>In stone age there are no 8-hour work days. Men work only as much as needed to live that day. The rest is free time: sleep, play, art, sex, rough-and-tumble, musing, thinking</p></li>

<p>Hypothesis: the expected damage of wars is constant. A war between two kingdoms is 1,000 times less likely but 1,000 times more destructive than a war between two tribes.

<p>Good laws satisfactorily answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are we going to enforce it?</li>
<li>What is the worst that haters can do?</li>
<li>What questions might arise?</li>
<li>What undefined cases?</li>
</ul>
<p>Good laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be enforced practically (sane effort and cost)</li>
<li>Addresses the root cause of the problem</li>
<li>Minimizes unintended effects (is well-targeted)</li>
<li>Is complete (handle all cases) and Leaves no questions</li>
<li>Is timeless/future-proof (doesn't depend on time) (is this even possible?)</li>
</ul>
<p>People are creative. They will find ways around laws.</p>
<p>Questionable example: even-odd car license plate rule. If cars are cheap, then people will just buy two cars. The root cause of the problem is bad/expensive/unintegrated public transport.</p>
<p>Bad example: legislating morality. Are you going to visit each of the 100 million homes and install a camera?</p>
