<p>We can think of money as seed and human as soil. Some humans are fertile soils for money to grow. A poor person who wins a lottery soon loses all of it. A rich person who wins a lottery keeps getting richer. A fool and his money are soon parted. However, this way of thinking puts money first and human second.</p>
<p>We can think of how fast money flows through a person.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-vulnerability"><span class="section_number">1.2.2</span><span class="section_title">What is vulnerability?</span></h4>
<p>Trust is the assumption that others will not exploit our vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Everything is vulnerable. Vulnerabilities differ in their probability and the severity, and thus their expected damages. We protect our houses with gates to deter thieves. But we don't protect our houses against meteors. Meteors do more damage than thieves, but meteors are so rare that the expected damage of thieves exceeds the expected damage of meteors. We probabilistically reason that thieves are more risky than meteors.</p>
<h4 id="power"><span class="section_number">1.2.3</span><span class="section_title">Power</span></h4>
<p>We assume these primitive concepts: harm, violence.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How do we design a power literacy course?</p>
<p>If I ask you to wave your hand, will you do that? By following what I tell you, you have given me some power over you. Why do you give me power? Why do you let me control?</p>
<p>If I ask you to bark like a dog for $10, will you do that?</p>
<p>If I ask you to dig coal for $50,000 a year, will you do that? If I ask you to drill the Earth for oil for $50,000 a year, will you do that? What if I give you more money?</p>
<p>If I ask you to cut down a forest for $50,000 a year, will you do that? Somebody out there will do that.</p>
<p>You see, there is a common theme: you <em>let</em> others tell you what to do.</p>
<p>Rich people can only give you money. They don't cut down the trees themselves.</p>
<p>Why do we let others tell us what to do? Because they pay?</p>
<p>Why do we let money bend our will?</p></li>
<li><p>What is power?</p>
<p>Power is control.</p>
<p>The amount of power X has over Y is the amount of control X has over Y.</p>
<p>Power is the ability to harm.</p>
<p>Power is the potential to do violence.</p>
<p>To have power is to control. We say that <em>X has power over Y</em> to mean <em>X controls Y</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Why distribute power?</p>
<p>Keltner's paradox of power is a strong scientific reason for distributing power.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Feeling powerful reduces morality and inhibition.</p>
<p>Feeling powerless causes chronic stress.</p></li>
<li><p>Power and control?</p></li>
<li><p>Power is the flip side of trust?</p></li>
<li><p>How does one gain power?</p>
<p>By gaining trust.</p>
<p>X can have power over Y if and only if Y <em>lets</em> X have power over Y.</p>
<p>Employers control employees because employees <em>let</em> employers.</p>
<p>Government controls the governed because the governed <em>let</em> the government.</p>
<p>Gain power by sharing it?<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Now we understand where power comes from. Evil people have power because we <em>let</em> them. How do we let them?</p>
<p>By being employed by them to perpetuate their evil. Rich people are not destroying the environment. <em>We</em>, their employees, are destroying the environment, by doing what they want us to do. We, the coal miners. We, the power plant operators. We, the car sellers. <em>We are complicit</em>. We <em>let</em> them control us. It is our hands, the workers' hands, not the rich people's hands, who murder the kids, who launches the missiles.</p>
<p><em>All rich people can do is give us money.</em> If we accept that money and we do evil, then we ourselves are at fault.</p>
<p>Companies and rich people are not to blame. We the complicit majority are to be blame. We are sleepwalking. We are not aware of our own power. We have power but we are afraid to use it.</p>
<p>But even if we are not complicit, those rich people will just buy machines and destroy the environment anyway? Therefore they are truly immoral? Why do they take pride in short-term profit maximization? Who taught them?</p>
<p>Government must come from the people. US government is for the rich only, not for the people. The candidates are rich people. The government listens only to rich people. The government does what is good for rich people. There is never a grassroot candidate.</p>
<p>But we have to feed our families. Where do we get money? This is the wrong question. The question is: How do we feed our families? <em>We</em> can farm ourselves. We feed them directly from our own labor. Nature always gives to those who work, to those who hunt, gather, or farm. Nature does not discriminate. Only in nature, those who do not work do not eat. A seed does not care about the color of the hand that sows it.</p></li>
<li><p>Where does one get power?</p>
<p>From nature. Some of us grow to be strong and healthy people, by virtue of good genetics, good habit, and good nourishment.</p></li>
<li><p>How does one lose power?</p>
<p>By losing trust.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="risk"><span class="section_number">1.2.4</span><span class="section_title">Risk</span></h4>
<p>Related words: danger, hazard, chance, gamble, probability, uncertainty, contingency.</p>
<p>(We are resisting the temptation of digressing to probability theory and statistics.)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is risk?</p>
<p>Did Warren Buffett say that risk comes from not understanding what we are doing?</p>
<p>Risk comes from Italian &quot;riscare&quot; which means &quot;to run into danger&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Risk is danger.</p>
<p>Danger is something that may harm.</p>
<p>Risk has negative connotation.</p></li>
<li><p>What is hazard?</p>
<p>&quot;Hazard&quot; was the name of a game of chance played with dice<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. In 2019, &quot;hazard&quot; means danger.</p></li>
<li><p>What is chance?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it absurd to buy or build things that we hope to never have to use?</p>
<p>Insurance buyers hope to never have to use it, because having to use it means shit has happened. We hope that shit doesn't happen. When you buy a scissor, you expect to use it. Insurance is the only thing that you buy but hope to never have to use it.</p>
<p>If I buy a gun, I hope to never have to use it.</p>
<p>If I buy a fire extinguisher, I hope to never have to use it. Is it absurd for me to buy a fire extinguisher?</p>
<p>We hope that we never have to use atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Having to use an insurance or a gun means that something bad has happened. We don't want bad things to happen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php">https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php</a></p>

<li><p>How little trust can we live with?</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="contract-is-trustdistrust"><span class="section_number">1.2.6</span><span class="section_title">Contract is trust/distrust?</span></h4>
<p>Signing a contract that obliges you is trusting.</p>
<p>Signing a contract that gives you a right is distrusting.</p>
<p>We make a contract because we want the state to help us when the other party breaches the contract. Thus we make a contract because we distrust the other party.</p>
<p>Contracts reduces the amount of trust required for trade.</p>
<p>If the state did not exist, would we still make contracts? We would rely on honor, and not the state.</p>
<p>But underlying every contract is the assumption that the state is honorable.</p>
<p>Contract assumes a third-party enforcer that is powerful and honorable (just, fair, neutral, reliable).</p>

<ul>
<li>Weapons enhance our ability to kill.
<ul>
<li>Weapons enhance our ability to scare.</li>
<li>Thus weapons enables better-armed people to oppress worse-armed people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Order of magnitude of weapon effectiveness
<ul>
<li>With a blade, one person can subdue 1 unarmed person.</li>
<li>With a pistol, one person can subdue 10 unarmed people.</li>
<li>With a machine gun, one person can subdue 100 unarmed people.</li>
<li>With a bomb such as that in Oklahoma city bombing, one person can subdue 1,000 unarmed people.</li>
<li>With a nuclear bomb such as those dropped by the USA on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War 2, one person can subdue 1,000,000 unarmed people.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Order of magnitude of media deception effectiveness?
<ul>
<li>This is totally baseless. How do we estimate this?</li>
<li>With hearsay, one person can deceive ten people?</li>
<li>With paper, one person can deceive a hundred people?</li>
<li>With newspaper or WhatsApp, one person can deceive a million people?</li>
<li>With television or Facebook or Google, one person can deceive a hundred million people?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The only way for the oppressed to fight back is:
<ul>
<li>total guerrilla warfare</li>
<li>living near to the oppressor (so that he can't nuke)</li>
<li>terrorism
<ul>
<li>Is there really no other way? Dialogs? Referendums?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Why do people give up their power so easily?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we live in a society whose morality goes against ours?</p>
<p>How do we live in a society whose morality clashes with our morality, without demeaning the people that we think are immoral? How do we live morally but without self-righteousness?</p></li>
<li><p>If we need to be evil to change something evil, should we be evil?</p></li>
<li><p>Should we do the necessary evil?</p>
<p>If we believe that power should be distributed, but we need power to change the world, should we temporarily (~ 100 years) centralize power on us? Can we trust ourselves, as power tends to corrupt?</p></li>
<li><p>Legal fictions?</p>
<p>Philosophically-unsound legal fictions such as corporate personhood create unnecessary misery.</p>
<p>Litigation is part of the problem, not part of the solution. Justice should at least be restorative.</p>
<p>Problem: &quot;That’s why if your toaster explodes, you have to sue the company that makes the toaster. You can’t sue the company’s shareholders. The company and its shareholders are distinct legal persons, with different legal rights and duties.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>How would the combination of restorative justice and no-corporation handle exploding toasters? What is the anarchist approach to litigating one who makes an exploding toaster that hurts someone else?</p>
<p>&quot;If Corporations Are People, They Should Act Like It&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Both governments and corporations are part of the problem.</p>
<p>Anarchy is a <em>privilege</em>. Freedom is expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Capitalism does not benefit us; free trade does?</p></li>
<li><p>Legal system is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Nobody knows all laws that are in effect. Not the legislators. Not the judges.</p></li>
<li><p>Parallels between master-slave and lessor-lessee</p>
<p>&quot;Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom,[97] and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>That sounds very much like the relationship between a lessee (tenant/renter) and a lessor (landlord). A lessee practically will never have enough money to buy the lessor's property; the economic system guarantees that. For example, in 2019, my neighbor is asking IDR 3 billion for his 72-m2 land and house on it. A typical frugal man who saves IDR 3 million monthly salary will need to save for 83 years, assuming over-optimistically zero inflation. He would have died 20 years before he had saved enough to buy the house!</p>
<p>In principle slavery has been abolished, but in practice the economic system guarantees that most people will forever live mediocre lives, although in much better condition than that of ancient Roman slaves. But we can do better.</p></li>
<li><p>What is ownership?</p></li>
<li><p>What is property?</p></li>
<li><p>What is slavery?</p>
<p>Slavery is the treatment of human as non-human property. Slavery is humans' owning humans.</p>
<p>Slavery violates the silver rule (do not do unto others what you do not want to be done unto yourself).</p></li>
<li><p>If everybody needs to eat, why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?</p>
<p>Food has been the best-selling thing for 40,000 years, but why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?</p>
<p>Here's a thought experiment that leads me to that question.</p>
<p>Imagine an economy that consists of 1 extremely frugal farmer and 1 doctor. After some time, money accumulates at the farmer, because the doctor always needs to eat, but the farmer doesn't always have a health problem.</p>
<p>A government has these options, from the least coercive to the most coercive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing, and hope that the farmer donates his money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Create more money and give it to the doctor. But the farmer may think that this is unfair.</li>
<li>Tax the farmer and give that tax money to the doctor.</li>
<li>Force the farmer to spend his money on the doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current economic system suffers from money accumulation.</p>
<p>Is accumulation of money bad? Is inequality bad?</p></li>
<li><p>What is ownership?</p>
<p>What does owning something mean?</p></li>
<li><p>What is property?</p>
<p>Is property theft?</p></li>
<li><p>If everyone owned a piece of fertile land, poverty should not exist?</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="work-employment"><span class="section_number">1.3.3</span><span class="section_title">Work, employment</span></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>We should not conflate work and employment</p>
<p>Work gives life meaning.</p>
<p>Employment is subjugation. X employs Y because X has a better idea about what Y should do with Y's time in order to make more profits for X.</p>
<p>Some people are lucky enough to have their work coincide with their employment. They are lucky enough to be enslaved to do what they want to do anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Dangerous freedom vs comfortable slavery?</p>
<p>Would we rather live free but hard, or would we rather be comfortable in an enslavement by a good master who can give us more than we could get in a free life? <em>But how could this master have so much money to pay everybody in the first place?</em></p></li>
<li><p>What is work without employment?</p>
<p>Work without subjugation. Work without power asymmetry.</p>
<p>Work gives life meaning. We like work and dislike employment. We want a world in which we work because we want to, not because we have to.</p>
<p>What is work? Work is purposeful deed/action. The difference between work and leisure is teleological. What is employment?</p>
<p>Life <em>is</em> work. Your work defines you. You are only as good as your contribution to the world. Your work defines the meaning of your life.</p>
<p>Don't confuse working with employment. Work is everything that creates value. Employment is subjugation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does employment and slavery compare?</p>
<ul>
<li>Slavery is the ownership of humans.</li>
<li>Employment is the rental of humans.</li>
<li><p>How has slavery changed?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Humans used to buy humans. Now humans rent other humans.</p>
<ul>
<li>2018: we can even rent a friend.</li>

<li><p>Raising kids while working?</p>
<p>It is impractical to raise kids while working, but not while being employed.</p>
<p>My guess of division of labor in stone age: Able men and childless women find food. Women and old men raise children.</p>
<p>In stone age there are no 8-hour work days. Men work only as much as needed to live that day. The rest is free time: sleep, play, art, sex, rough-and-tumble, musing, thinking</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Labor without hiring?</p>
<p>By hiring I mean employment/wage/salary.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about anarchistic labor, a form of voluntary labor that is not subject to labor laws. Get paid by result not by time. Work anywhere. Resign anytime. No non-competes, no non-disclosures, no grace periods. Work on something ethical and meaningful.</p></li>

<li><p>States make wars somewhat less often but much more severe</p>
<p>A war between two tribes kills about 100 people. A war between two 11th-century kingdoms<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> kills about 100,000 people. A war between two 20th-century states kills about 1,000,000 people. A war between two 20th-century state-alliances kills about 70,000,000 people. A war between two planetary governments may kill billions of people. This does not yet count the people hurt but not killed by the war.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: the expected damage of wars is constant. A war between two kingdoms is 1,000 times less likely but 1,000 times more destructive than a war between two tribes. For example, if a tribe went to war every day, then a kingdom would go to war every 3 years. But Harrison and Wolf 2012 <span class="citation" data-cites="harrison2012frequency">[<a href="#ref-harrison2012frequency">3</a>]</span> falsifies that hypothesis.</p>
<p>States enable long-term peace with the risk of occasional catastrophic wars.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll</a></p>

<li>What is the worst that haters can do?</li>
<li>What questions might arise?</li>
<li>What undefined cases?</li>

<p>Good laws:</p>

<li>Can be enforced practically (sane effort and cost)</li>
<li>Addresses the root cause of the problem</li>
<li>Minimizes unintended effects (is well-targeted)</li>
<li>Is complete (handle all cases) and Leaves no questions</li>
<li>Is timeless/future-proof (doesn't depend on time) (is this even possible?)</li>
</ul>
<p>People are creative. They will find ways around laws.</p>
<p>Questionable example: even-odd car license plate rule. If cars are cheap, then people will just buy two cars. The root cause of the problem is bad/expensive/unintegrated public transport.</p>
<p>Bad example: legislating morality. Are you going to visit each of the 100 million homes and install a camera?</p>

<p>There are only two ways to get rich: <em>earn</em> wealth or <em>steal</em> wealth.</p>
<p>Earn wealth: convince people to give you money, by selling them things that improve their lives. Use the money to develop your wealth even more.</p>
<p>Or steal wealth: An investor steals a little wealth from each person who does not invest.</p>
<p>After you obtain enough wealth, develop it, but don't lose all of them.</p>

<li>Corporates were invented by aristocrats to make sure peasants stay peasants?</li>
<li><p><a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-the-internet-and-the-future-of-business">transcript</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We should verify and distill these texts. These are some bold claims.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;As the peasants became wealthy the aristocracy got scared, who are these people? They're not going to be dependent on us any more. So they came up with two main financial innovations to prevent the rise of this peer to peer economy. The first one was the chartered monopoly, really the parent to the modern corporation. All the chartered monopoly was was a way to say all of you small businesses are now illegal. If you want to be in the shoe business you have to work for his majesty's royal shoe company. You want to be in the grain business you have to work for his majesty's royal grain company. So people who were small business people now became employees. Instead of selling the value they created, now they sold their time as servants, as wage laborers.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The second invention they came up with was central currency. Not such a terrible thing in itself. It's great to have a long distance currency that lots of people can use and value, but the problem was they made all of the local currencies illegal. So the only way people could trade with each other, the candlestick maker could trade with the chicken farmer was by borrowing central currency from the treasury. So now you had to borrow money at interest just in order to transact. And that set in motion really a growth cascade. If you have a currency that has to be paid back with interest, in order to just make end meet you need an economy that's growing. You need more money next year than there was this year.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;So that worked well for colonial powers, as long as we could extend into Africa and South America and North America, find slaves, find new resources, we could grow. But what happens when you reach the end of the planet's growth as we did really at the end of World War II?&quot;</li>

<li><p>Everyday there are stocks that rise by 20% and there are stocks that fall by 20%.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we can predict which will rise, we can get rich quickly.</li>
<li><p>Why do prices rise? Because buyers concede to sellers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because there is more buying pressure than selling pressure.</li>
<li>Because there is more buy orders than sell orders.</li>
<li>Because more people buy.</li>
<li>Because less people sell.</li>
<li>Because more people buy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why do people buy a stock?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because they believe it will rise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why do they believe so?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallacious reasoning. Psychological bias. Appeal to authority. Hearsay. Fear of missing out. Irrational exuberance?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Because they believe it will give them dividends.</li>

<li><p>How do we persuade/encourage people to buy a stock? How do you market a stock?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is gray area. Is it even legal?</li>

<li><p>Hypothesis: Some companies' financial statements predict economic/financial crises.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How are economic crises even possible if there is enough money for everybody?</p>
<ul>
<li>Uneven distribution of money?</li>
<li><p>Hypothesis: The solution to an economic crisis is a forced redistribution of money, an economic reboot/restart, however unpleasant.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an economic crisis, tax the wealthy and pay the poor.</li>
<li>I think that is an optimal solution (if not the only solution), but that is politically incorrect, so we'll never see that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If ignored, economic crisis will escalate to sociopolitical crisis.</p></li>

<li>Banks lend money with interest. Thus, paying back the loans reduce circulating money.</li>

<li><p>wealth</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wealth</em> is the sum of satisfied wants.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>price, pay, ownership, exchange, transaction</p>
<ul>
<li>To <em>own</em> something is to have exclusive access to that thing.</li>
<li><em>Exchange</em> and <em>transaction</em> are synonyms.</li>
<li><p>An <em>exchange</em> is an agreement</p>
<ul>
<li><p>between two parties A and B where</p>
<ul>
<li>A gives X to B,</li>
<li>B gives Y to A.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If X is money and Y is not money, then:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>X is the price.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Price</em> is the amount agreed for exchange.</li>
<li><em>Price</em> is something sacrificed to get something else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A is the buyer.</li>
<li>B is the seller.</li>
<li><p>The buyer <em>pays</em> the price to the seller.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>negotiation, price-taker, price-maker</p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiating parties often have asymmetrical bargaining power.</li>
<li>The price-taker is the weaker one.</li>
<li>The price-maker is the stronger one.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>money and currency</p>
<ul>
<li>Money has <em>currency</em> and <em>amount</em> (<em>magnitude</em>).</li>
<li>Money can be <em>exchanged</em> with many other things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>debt, interest, and price</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The price of debt is the <em>interest</em> (the amount of money that will be exchanged for obtaining the loan now).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An X market is a market where X is traded.</p>

<li><p>Land &gt; Labor &gt; Capital</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production">factors of production</a> in classical economics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>land (all other things that exist in nature),</li>
<li>labor (human),</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Land creates labor.</li>
<li>Labor creates capital.</li>
<li>If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.</li>
<li>If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.</li>
<li>Labor without capital is inefficient.</li>
<li>Capital without labor is <em>nothing</em>.</li>
<li>However, without land, nothing would exist at all.</li>
<li><p>Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,</p>
<ul>
<li>but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related: &gt; When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted; &gt; when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late, &gt; that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can't eat money. &gt; &gt; Alanis Obomsawin (b. 1932) (<a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/10/20/last-tree-cut/">source</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Questions I haven't been able to answer</p>

<li><p>If everybody needs to buy food, then why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What if the farmers don't spend?</p>
<ul>
<li>Will money collect at the farmers?</li>
<li>Will they be the richest people on Earth?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Money circulation</p>
<ul>
<li>Circulating money amount should be proportional to amount of goods/services exchanged?</li>
<li>The amount of money in circulation can be reduced by tax or destruction.</li>
<li><p>Why do governments sell bonds?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To reduce the amount of money in circulation now?</p>
<ul>
<li>At the cost of increasing a bigger amount of money circulating in the future?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Money moves faster in certain areas?</li>
<li><p>How does the government increases the amount of money in circulation?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How I think it might be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new money.</li>
<li><p>Spend that money by buying things from a few elites,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>with the hope that the elites will quickly spend that money to the lesser elites.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thus that money will circulate to more people.</p>
<ul>
<li>But isn't this trickle-down economics?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But does it even do this? Isn't it the banks?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is the effect of people's borrowing from banks?</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase circulating money now (boom part of boom-bust cycle).</li>
<li><p>Reduce <em>more</em> circulating money later (bust part of boom-bust cycle, when the loan is paid back with interest).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Principal plus interest (money retired) is greater than principal (money created), so the net effect of lending money now is a delayed reduction of a greater amount of money in circulation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where does the money to pay the interest come from?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If left alone, eventually the money collects at the banks?</p>
<ul>

<p>We say that a person <em>gambles</em> iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:</p>
<ul>
<li>There exists a bet.</li>
<li>There does not exist control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can two unskilled people playing chess control the outcome?</p>
<p>Wager and bet are synonyms.</p>
<p>The gambler doesn't have <em>any</em> control over the outcome of a gamble. How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation? Too hard to predict?</p>
<p>The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't. The casino can control the outcome.</p>
<p>Although the individual outcomes are unpredictable, the trend is predictable.</p>
<p>Insurance is reverse gambling, which is also gambling. It is absurd to buy something that you avoid using.</p>

<li>&quot;Insurance is a very specific type of gambling.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead), the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example), and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit).&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?</p>
<p>Is professional poker gambling? If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.</p>
<p>If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.</p>
<p>Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people? Slot machines? Guessing computer-generated numbers? What is a possible physical explanation?</p>
<p>How do we argue that binary option is gambling?</p>
<p>I saw binary options marketed with fake Facebook comments. I know those Facebook comments are fake because all of them have perfect grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. Real Facebook comment threads are full of shit.</p>

<p>What Bitcoin &quot;investing&quot; is:</p>
<ul>
<li>You buy a certificate of environmental destruction from someone, probably a &quot;miner&quot;.</li>
<li>You expect a greater fool to buy that certificate from you at a higher price. There are millions of other people who are looking for someone else more stupid than them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin is massive wealth transfer from late buyers to early buyers. All financial investing is massive &quot;realistic-return&quot; Ponzi scheme. Exactly fits the definition. Newcomers pay oldtimers. Late buyers pay early buyers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is not necessary at all. It is pure want. Inflation target disincentivizes currency hoarding. A deflating currency encourages currency hoarding and discourages real spending. <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-the-economics-of-bitcoin.html">https://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-the-economics-of-bitcoin.html</a></p>

<p>Price is not important in itself. It is the quality-price trade-off that is important. People don't buy shit even if it's cheap, even if you pay them to buy it.</p>
<p>For an increment of quality, people are willing to pay an increment of price. But there is a &quot;good enough&quot; point where people are satisfied and they just look at the lowest price.</p>
<p>Negative price means willingness to pay to get rid of something. Example: rotten vegetables has negative price to most people, but positive price to farmers.</p>
<h3 id="economics-1"><span class="section_number">3.12</span><span class="section_title">Economics?</span></h3>
<p>We should measure debt-to-income ratio instead of debt-to-GDP ratio?</p>
<p>Consumptive debt sacrifices future for the present.</p>
<p>Productive debt is good.</p>
<p>Example of productive debt:</p>
<p>Suppose that you want to buy a land to farm on it. These are the scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>You work for 20 years. Then you buy the land with cash. But the land price has risen.</li>
<li>You take a loan, buy the land now, and repay the loan over 10 years. In the second year, your land starts producing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a person takes too much consumptive debt, he goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>If a government takes too much consumptive debt nominated in its own currency, it can print money to repay the debt, but such printing devalues the currency.</p>
<p>If the US continues to take loans mindlessly, it will have to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default (refuse to repay).</li>
<li>Suffer severe inflation (rising prices), if the creditors spend the printed money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the USA think it can get away by refusing to repay its debts? It will trigger a huge power shift, maybe to China. Will China sacrifice itself to clean up America's mess? Will China buy up all US debts, and use the default as a reason to start a war?</p>

Indeed Firefox and Chrome has already done that with Firefox OS and Chrome OS.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The browser should also be a crowd-sourced search engine and a peer-to-peer web hosting?</p>

<p>The user is in full control of everything, including the content displayed to him. The user can program the browser to transform badly-designed websites. The user should not need to install a plugin such as Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or any other &quot;user script manager&quot; to have full control of what is displayed.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-browsers-have-history"><span class="section_number">5.1.3</span><span class="section_title">Why do browsers have history?</span></h4>
<p>What is the chance that the user asks one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I just browse?</li>
<li>What did I browse yesterday?</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the chance that the user wants to revisit something?</p>
<p>I myself often need that.</p>

<h4 id="how-hard-is-it-to-secure-a-browser"><span class="section_number">5.1.4</span><span class="section_title">How hard is it to secure a browser?</span></h4>
<p>Very hard.</p>
<p>We may think that API A is secure and API B is secure, but when we use them together, A+B may not be secure.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>How do we make systems whose security is composable?</p>
<p>How do we prove that a system is secure? How should we model security?</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="barthe2017provably">[<a href="#ref-barthe2017provably">2</a>]</span> is a possibility. But what if new unforeseen side-channel attacks appear in the future?</p>
<p>We must model the time and energy usage of each CPU instruction. But the CPU is not open source?</p>
<h4 id="parts-of-a-browser"><span class="section_number">5.1.5</span><span class="section_title">Parts of a browser</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>cache and history</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li>HTML parsing</li>
<li>rendering HTML DOM to GUI widgets</li>
</ul>
<p>What we choose <em>not</em> to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>plug-ins, extensions</li>
<li>themes, customizations</li>
</ul>
<p>Who are going to maintain the plugins?</p>
<p>Should we just embed WebKit?</p>

<h4 id="search-engine"><span class="section_number">5.1.6</span><span class="section_title">Search engine?</span></h4>
<p>Is AntRank<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> usable?</p>
<p>I find YaCy<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> unusable: its search result relevance is too far behind Google. YaCy-related things<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> seem to also suffer from usability issues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's 2019, NAT is still common, and I don't see IPv6 anywhere near my computer.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a bad idea to allow <em>every</em> device to be connected to the Internet. Weakly-passworded IP cameras were hijacked and put into a botnet.</p>
<h4 id="why-dont-users-use-distributed-systems"><span class="section_number">5.1.7</span><span class="section_title">Why don't users use distributed systems?</span></h4>
<p>Users don't care; they want software to just work.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>We should make a &quot;freedom pack&quot;: an installer of essential free/libre open-source distributed-web applications. The pack might contain things like matrix.org, riot.im. But why stop there? Why not make free/libre distributed operating system<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> with all those goodies preinstalled?</p>
