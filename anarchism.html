    <p>Your goal is noble, but, for your message to be acceptable by the people,
you must use the word “self-governance” instead of “anarchy”.
No need to change anything else, just replace all occurrences of “anarchy” with “self-governance”.
This will make your speeches and writings infinitely more acceptable
to the uneducated people that you need.
No more wasting time explaining what “anarchy” really is.</p>

<p>It does not benefit you to use a word that has been redefined by everyone else.
Your meaning of “anarchy” dates back to Proudhon’s 1840 treatise “What is property?”
It’s 2018, almost 200 years since Proudhon,
and the topmost Google search result for “anarchy” today
is “a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority”.
You see, even the dictionaries and the Internet are conspiring against you.
Nobody wins a fight against the Internet.
You need a new word.</p>

<p>The word “anarchy” focuses on the absence of a ruler.
It gives the impression that you are a belligerent forever
plotting a coup d’etat against your nemesis the government.
You don’t want that.
You want to maximize everyone’s freedom,
and you want people to associate voluntarily,
which is to say that they self-govern.
The word “self-governance” gives the impression that you are
a youthful progressive bunch of people
with positive success mindset brimming with can-do attitude.
It sounds like bullshit, but flowery bullshit sells better than ugly truth.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that words change meanings, but language changes with the people who speak it.
You won’t see any progress until you change the word you use to spread your message.</p>

<p>The word “anarchy” is, in today’s context, bad for marketing your cause.</p>

<p>Thus, from now on, say and write “self-governance” instead of “anarchy”.</p>
