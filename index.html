<p>&lt;2019-08-14&gt;</p>
<p>I propose this one small painless change to the way we interpret English: We declare that &quot;he&quot; is always gender-neutral and never implies maleness. Thus, in the singular case, we now have a gender-neutral human pronoun &quot;he&quot;, a female human pronoun &quot;she&quot;, a non-human pronoun &quot;it&quot;, and <em>no male pronouns</em>.</p>
<p>My solution requires inventing no new words as it is already common to use &quot;he&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun. The change is minimal, undisruptive, and painless.</p>
<p>Now let us see how the new interpretation prevents hurt feelings. Consider this conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: &quot;You have a child? What is his occupation?&quot;</p>
<p>Bob: &quot;She is unemployed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the old interpretation, Bob is implicitly correcting Alice. In the new interpretation, Bob is simply giving more information to Alice without implying at all that Alice wrongly guessed the gender of his child.</p>
<p>It takes only one generation to teach this for this to feel normal. It's just a matter of consensus.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Combining these different pieces of information does not happen in an orderly linear process.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Writer’s block often comes from being too closely linked to the linearity of a process and the inability to break out small pieces of text to work on and move with ideas.&quot;</li>

<p>&lt;2019-08-11&gt;</p>
<p>Our &quot;computer science&quot; label has misled people into thinking that we can fix their computers.</p>
<p>Although the first computer scientists did study computers, computer scientists now don't study computers anymore because software has grown too big; now computer scientists study mostly software, and the hardware is supposed to be studied by <em>computer engineers</em>.</p>
<p>A honestly-named computer-science student should study both hardware and software because a computer has a hardware part and a software part, But, in fact, a computer-science student studies much more software than hardware, and will often work with software while taking hardware for granted in their jobs.</p>
<p>Perhaps universities should also merge law departments and computer science departments into <em>software departments</em>.</p>
<p>On second thought, perhaps we should not call ourselves &quot;software scientists&quot; because we don't even know what software is. Perhaps we should just call ourselves &quot;computer programmers&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="software-structural-engineering"><span class="section_number">3.3</span><span class="section_title">Software structural engineering</span></h3>
<p>&lt;2019-08-15&gt;</p>
<p>Here we transplant <em>civil structural engineering</em> to <em>software structural engineering</em> by analogy.</p>
<p>Both civil structural engineers and software structural engineers do <em>capacity planning</em> and <em>load testing</em>.</p>
<p>Civil structural engineers deal with the <em>strength of materials</em>, whereas software structural engineers deal with the <em>emptying rate of queues</em>.</p>
<p>The science of civil structural engineering is based on <em>continuum mechanics</em>, whereas the science of software structural engineering is based on <em>queuing theory</em>.</p>
<p>Material breakage is analogous to <em>full queue</em>.</p>
<p>When a civil structure fails, the <em>building</em> collapses. When a software structure fails, the <em>system performance</em> collapses: latency skyrockets and throughput drops.</p>
<p>Structural engineers design structures to <em>withstand probable adversities</em> according to cost-benefit analysis. Civil structural engineers design structures to withstand <em>heat, wind, earthquakes, etc.</em> Software structural engineers design systems to withstand <em>load spikes, network disruptions, disk failures, etc.</em> If we are building a skyscraper in an earthquake-prone region, we must seriously consider earthquakes. If we are building a system for 1,000,000 concurrent users, we must seriously consider traffic spikes, network disruptions, and other adversities. If we are merely building a system with 10,000 lines of code for 10 users, and it will stay that way for 100 years, then it is a waste of resources to bake in a grandiose architecture. If you need a shack, and it will satisfy you for 1,000 years, then perhaps don't build a skyscraper.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-17&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>appeal-to-evolution</em> is this argument: <em>If a trait would hamper the survival of a species, then that species would not have evolved that trait.</em></p>
<p>It is a heuristic. It is not always correct. For example, it cannot explain peacock tails. However, it seems reasonable in absence of other information.</p>
<p>The appeal-to-evolution weakens the theory that irregular eating causes gastritis as follows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very early hunter-gatherer humans ate irregularly; they were always a few days away from starvation, they did not have a secure food supply, they depend very much on their surroundings. <em>Having gastritis due to irregular eating would hamper their survival.</em> Therefore they probably evolved such that irregular eating does not cause gastritis.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-07-07&gt;</p>
<p>The Boeing 737 MAX fiasco is not a software accident, because the software is working as intended, that is as a crutch to work around bad hardware design due to cost-cutting. That plane is a pile of workarounds: that software is a workaround for bad hardware which is a workaround for bad business decisions. They are making planes as game companies make games: They think they can just release crashing planes and patch the planes later, but planes kill people when they crash, whereas games don't. That fiasco is a case of prioritizing profits before engineering, but unfortunately, Nature, the judge, will always grant victory to physics, when physics and profits disagree. But can we blame companies for seeking profit, because profit is necessary for their survival? Does it mean that airplanes should be made by non-profits? But who is going to do anything at all, if not for profit? But why can't we just gather the people who are good at building airplanes, and give them money and tools to build airplanes? Software companies do this all the time.</p>
<p>My first solution attempt is to make organizations in which people just build the best planes they can. They may compete, but they must not compete to survive. Competition may exist, but must not be an existential threat. Non-profits would be even more efficient if there were no competition. But even non-profits need money, and that money has to come from somewhere, and no one is going to suddenly donate some billion dollars and start a non-profit organization that makes airplanes. Or is anyone going to do that? The richest people can do that, but will they?</p>
<p>The root cause of the Boeing 737 MAX crashes is that competition presents an existential threat to companies. If I had to design a plane while facing an existential threat, such as being held at a gunpoint, then my plane would probably crash too, as I cut corners to save my life. So the question is, how do we remove the gun, so that I can design planes in peace, while also ensuring that my design makes sense physically and economically?</p>
<p>Competition has given us big companies that produce all luxuries that our ancestors could only imagine but we take for granted. But the future is cooperative, not competitive.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-15&gt;</p>
<p>In 2019, anyone who thinks that guns can protect them from tyrannical governments is deluded. Governments have better guns, soldiers, cops, bombs, planes, drones, tanks, nukes, and a monopoly on violence bigger than ever in history. Nevertheless, guns can be used to terrorize government employees to discourage people from working for the government,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> but I don't recommend that, and I don't plan to discuss asymmetric warfare<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and militant anarchism here.</p>
<p>Thus the only reason left for gun rights is to let people sell guns for profit.</p>

<p>Jakarta is sinking into the sea.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> At the same time, the sea is rising due to melting polar ice due to climate change. Also recently there was an all-time-high level of air pollution. The future is grim. Only a natural disaster can fix this sinking polluted overcrowded city.</p>
<p>Jakarta is barely livable. Atrocious traffic. Severe dust.</p>
<p>Why aren't there more buses? Why aren't there more routes? How hard is it to start a bus company? Why, in the last 30 years, has there never been a bus route through my area?</p>

<p>An animation<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> explains why:</p>
<ul>
<li>People pump the aquifers out.</li>
<li>Rain can't replenish the aquifers because Jakarta is wrapped in concrete.</li>
<li>There is no more underground water to press the land up.</li>
<li>The land sinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>North Jakarta is sinking by up to 20 cm per year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government is planning to move the capital from Jakarta to Palangkaraya.</p>

<h3 id="is-freedom-of-speech-important"><span class="section_number">7.6</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-07-06&gt; Is freedom of speech important?</span></h3>
<p>Examples of degrees of freedom of speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>In USA and Canada, you can talk shit about the government, as long as you don't make death threats, or the cops will get you.</li>
<li>In Indonesia, you can disagree with the government, but you have to do it very politely, or you will be jailed.</li>
<li>In China, if you disagree with the government, your will be encumbered, if not killed.</li>
<li>In Saudi Arabia, if you disagree with the government, you will be killed.</li>
</ul>
<p>But all government is more similar than different: There is always centralization of power, and therefore abuse of power.</p>
<p>Without freedom of speech, life goes on pretty much normally in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the USA, for all its free speech, still has problems like crony capitalism and highest gun-related murder which is totally preventable as shown by the Australians.</p>
<p>Why do you insist on owning a gun? It does not protect you from a tyrannical government. They have bombs, armies, nukes, soldiers, cops, gunboats, aircrafts, hackers, money, what else. If you think your teeny-pistol militia can beat them, you're as deluded as Don Quixote; but actually he has better chances than you do, because windmills don't fight back, whereas governments do. The freedom to bear arms is just a ceremonial distraction from more important issues such as imperialism, privacy, and borders.</p>

<p>When a surgeon fails, he injures one people. When a car driver fails, he injures ten people. When a lawmaker fails, he injures millions of people. Then why do we insist on lower standards for our lawmakers than for our surgeons? Why do we elect clueless clowns and self-enriching thiefs into the government? <em>Because we pay for a surgery but not for an election</em>. Paying for something increases our expectation. We don't pay for an election, so we expect nothing.</p>
<p>But companies do pay for elections, through contributions and lobbyings. Thus companies expect to gain from elections, while people don't.</p>

<p>These entities may have done things that would be considered atrocities by 2019 standards: Muhammad<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>, Suharto<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>, the United States of America<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, the British Empire<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>, many imperialist European countries, Mao<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, Stalin<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>, Hitler<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, Genghis Khan, and many more<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, if not everyone.</p>
<p><em>But only Hitler lost the war.</em></p>
<p>Thus now Hitler is condemned, whereas the others are venerated.</p>
<p>It is a crime to murder one person. It is not a crime to wage an unjust war <em>and win the war</em> because the winner gets to define what &quot;crime&quot; is, and then he gets to write the history. This is just human nature. Even I myself suffer from that: I often find myself imagining the killing of billions of people, be it by my own hands or by a natural catastrophe, and I imagine the peace that follows, the problems that disappear, the overcrowding gone, the pollution gone, the noise-makers gone, the exorbitant land prices fall.</p>
<p>There is no government for countries, and thus countries go to war against other countries. At the level of citizens, there is a rule of law, but at the level of countries, it is anarchy. Thus it seems that there has to be a government for governments, but this suffers from infinite regress: second-level governments may go to war with each other, and so on. Thus, the only way to global peace is <em>to have exactly one government for all people</em>, one World Government, because it is impossible to have a war if there is nobody else to wage a war against, that is, if you are the only government in the world. This is the only way to prevent wars.</p>
<p>This World Government should be filled with scientists and engineers because they do politics better than politicians do; see China<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>, but it's changing in 2017.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>But people are too chauvinistic, too egoistic, and too proud for a World Government. All nationalism is chauvinism, because we are all citizens of the Earth. As technology is heading toward a singularity, human culture is also heading toward a singularity.</p>
<p>Having different governments also enables tax avoidance, money laundering, and wage slavery, by enabling one to arbitrage different regulations in different countries.</p>

<p>Really no 3rd party in this NAT traversal?<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>There are two approaches to living:</p>
<ul>
<li>There-first: Start with what you want, and find what you should have: Find what things have to exist in order to satisfy the goal.</li>

<p>At 10 years old, we are friends because we are in the same class, and we don't have better things to do. Simple physical proximity. But we stop being friends as soon as we graduate out of school.</p>
<p>At 20 years old, we are friends because we are in the same company. We stop being friends as soon as we resign.</p>
<p>At 30 years, we are friends because we share a goal or hobby or problem, because we care about a common thing. We stop being friends as soon as our problem is solved.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-make-this-website"><span class="section_number">10.1</span><span class="section_title">Why do you make this website?</span></h3>
<p>Because I find thinking, writing, and planning fun. This website contains questions that I think should be answered.</p>
<p>I think of myself as three different people:</p>
<ul>
<li>my past self</li>
<li>my present self</li>
<li>my future self</li>
</ul>
<p>This website is a way for those three people to communicate.</p>
<h3 id="who-are-you"><span class="section_number">10.2</span><span class="section_title">Who are you?</span></h3>
<p>I am an independent<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> researcher from Indonesia, with too many interests, mostly theoretical, because theoretical research is low-cost and can be done at home<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a>, because I don't have the resources for experimental research. Most of my writings involve applied analytic philosophy, mathematics, and computers. (Applied analytic philosophy is the careful usage of words to discover the essence of things.)</p>
<p>My last formal education degree, if you care, is a Sarjana Ilmu Komputer<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> degree bestowed in 2011 by the Fakultas Ilmu Komputer<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> of Universitas Indonesia<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> for four years of undergraduate education.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-trust-you"><span class="section_number">10.3</span><span class="section_title">Should I trust you?</span></h3>
<p><em>No, you should not.</em> Anyone can put anything on the Internet. Judge for yourself. More disclaimers follow.</p>
<p><em>I may err.</em> Read cautiously. Compare with other independent sources. Do not trust me without thinking for yourself. Use your own judgement.</p>
<p><em>I am not responsible for what other people write in their comments,</em> but I can remove comments from my website. People are free to say whatever they want, and people are free to disagree with whatever others say, as long as they do that in a civilized manner.</p>
<p><em>I may change.</em> I am not attached to our beliefs. Things I wrote in the past should not be solely used to judge my present self.</p>
<p>Most pages are messy drafts. URLs may change.</p>
<p>If you have good eyesight, you may want to zoom out by pressing Control-minus. The fonts may be too big.</p>
<h3 id="how-should-i-interact-with-you"><span class="section_number">10.4</span><span class="section_title">How should I interact with you?</span></h3>
<p>You can pick one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave a Disqus comment in the related page.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/edom/edom.github.io/issues">Open an issue at GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect long delay. If you don't get a reply after waiting for a few days, try resending your message. It does get lost sometimes.</p>
<p>If you are in Jakarta, we may meet in some meetups.</p>
<h3 id="where-else-are-you"><span class="section_number">10.5</span><span class="section_title">Where else are you?</span></h3>
<p>I may also be found at these places, but I rarely check them:</p>

<h3 id="what-are-some-similar-websites"><span class="section_number">10.6</span><span class="section_title">What are some similar websites?</span></h3>
<p>These are some websites similar to this website and their differences.</p>
<p><a href="https://kevinbinz.com/">kevinbinz.com</a> is more like a blog than a wiki.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">en.wikipedia.org</a> does not want original content. (Also, if <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-feasible-to-move-Wikipedia-mediaWiki-from-PHP-to-some-modern-language-like-Golang">Kelly Kinkade's answer</a> is true, then it's worrying that so much human knowledge is stored in such unparseable MediaWiki markup language.)</p>
<p>TheBrain: the idea is good, but the app is slower than static web.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org">brainpickings.org</a>: too social, too much content, too little navigation, too little structure; pop science content is too much pop and too little science.</p>

            Disqus has been removed because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
            On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website are broken,
            and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.

                    Or, even better, contribute to a community wiki.
