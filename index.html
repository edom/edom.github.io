<h2 id="about-the-author-and-the-website"><span class="section_number">1</span><span class="section_title">About the author and the website</span></h2>
<p>My name is Erik Dominikus. I am an independent<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> researcher from Indonesia, with too many interests, mostly theoretical, because theoretical research is low-cost and can be done at home<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, because I don't have the resources for experimental research. Most of my writings involve applied analytic philosophy, mathematics, and computers. (Applied analytic philosophy is the careful usage of words to discover the essence of things.)</p>
<p>My last formal education degree, if you care, is a Sarjana Ilmu Komputer<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> degree bestowed in 2011 by the Fakultas Ilmu Komputer<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> of Universitas Indonesia<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> for four years of undergraduate education.</p>

<p>Perhaps now you are wondering &quot;What do you have for me?&quot; How do I answer that? It depends on your interests. You may wear multiple hats as I do. But I wrote this website primarily for myself. Thus the question becomes &quot;What do I have for myself&quot;, that is &quot;What do I really want&quot;, that is, &quot;What is important for me?&quot; If you have some common goals or interests, then get in touch, drop a comment. We should join forces to reach our shared goals.</p>

<p>I am <a href="publish.html">looking for a publishing system</a>. I also write <a href="emacs.html">Using Emacs and Org Mode</a>, <a href="emacsvi.html">Emacs for vi users</a>, <a href="writing.html">Writing</a>, and <a href="markdown.html">Working around Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>I am <a href="parse.html">looking for parsing techniques</a>, because parsing is the common thing between programming language and publishing system, and I am looking for both. Meanwhile, I had to understand Brzozowski quotient and set division, so I wrote <a href="division.html">Generalizing division</a>.</p>
<p>I am <a href="pnptry.html">trying to understand the P vs NP problem</a>, which requires <a href="compute.html">computation</a>, <a href="model.html">model</a>, and <a href="logic.html">logic</a>. I was motivated by the prize money<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, but I think my chances are slim.</p>
<p>I am looking for an AI that helps me process data into information. Thus I write <a href="intelligence.html">Making intelligence</a> and <a href="endo.html">The endofunction model of worlds and agents, and its philosophical implications</a>. But I think my chances are slim.</p>
<p>There are some interesting mathematical perspectives.</p>
<p>Boolean metric spaces merge logic and analysis? How do we define a sensible approximation error? How do we define the <em>distance</em> between two formulas?</p>

<h3 id="philosophy"><span class="section_number">3.3</span><span class="section_title">Philosophy</span></h3>
<p>I am trying to understand what <a href="model.html">model</a> is and what <a href="compute.html">computation</a> is.</p>
<p>I am <a href="philo.html">trying to understand the relationship between mind and brain</a>.</p>
<p>I am <a href="nature.html">trying to understand physics</a>.</p>
<p>I am <a href="finite.html">looking for a philosophically sound foundation of mathematics</a>. It may be finitism.</p>
<p>If people know some basic epistemology (that is, if they can tell apart what they know from what <em>they think</em> they know), then there will be no wars. Some epistemology should be taught in primary school. We often assume a lot of things about others. Most conflicts happen because we assume something wrong about someone else.</p>
<h3 id="society"><span class="section_number">3.4</span><span class="section_title">Society</span></h3>
<p>I am looking for a technology that empowers people and liberates people, a technology that makes oppression physically impossible. I am trying to codify (that is, to express in English) our implicit morality, that is, the implicit moral system that we have evolved. Thus I write <a href="social.html">Designing the ideal society</a>. I thought I could change the world with politics, but now I think politics only wastes time, and now I think technology is the only hope for making something in the physical-law layer to bypass the convoluted human-made-law layer. I think law should be principle-based, and justice should be restorative. I think the world needs only one law: Try not to harm others. Nobody bothers to fix the broken political systems. Nobody even bothers to think. Political systems are too expensive to fix; it is much cheaper to scrap them.</p>
<p>I <a href="usecom.html">use computers</a>. I <a href="phone.html">buy a smartphone</a> when my old smartphone becomes unusable. I usually watch YouTube at 2x-3x speed; we can speed it up to 16x<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Why users don't use distributed systems: Users don't care; they want software to just work.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I find YaCy<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> unusable: its search result relevance is too far behind Google. YaCy-related things<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> seem to also suffer from usability issues.</p>
<p>We should make a &quot;freedom pack&quot;: an installer of essential free/libre open-source distributed-web applications. The pack might contain things like matrix.org, riot.im. But why stop there? Why not make free/libre distributed operating system<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> with all those goodies preinstalled?</p>
<p>Example of federated/decentralized social networks: Kari Nordmann's comment<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>: &quot;Explore federated (decentralized) social networks (Mastodon, diaspora*, Friendica, Hubzilla, GNU Social, Socialhome, Pleroma, GangGo)&quot;</p>
<p>What is a constitution? Why should people in the 21st century agree with people in the 18th century? Why should we agree with people born 300 years ago? We don't even agree with our parents born 30 years ago!</p>
<h3 id="software-engineering"><span class="section_number">3.5</span><span class="section_title">Software engineering</span></h3>
<p>I am thinking about open-source. I prefer cooperation to competition. I write <a href="opensrc.html">Making contributable open-source projects</a>, <a href="community.html">Building online communities</a>. I am thinking about maintaining open-source projects.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think about forward software engineering, such as <a href="softeng.html">making lasting software sooner</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think about <a href="reveng.html">reverse software engineering</a>, such as<a href="ps1.html">Reverse-engineering PlayStation 1 3D games to control the camera</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to automate stock trading with my broker which has a stock trading application written in Java 6. Thus I wrote <a href="rejava.html">Reverse engineering the network protocol used by a Java desktop application</a>. But now I think financial economy is just a big Ponzi scheme full of rent-seeking, full of people who want to get a slice of the pie of real economy without growing the pie of real economy, full of people who just want to extract value from society without creating value, people who only take but don't give, people who only shuffle money around.</p>
<p>I tried to think about <a href="engman.html">managing software engineers</a>. I thought about <a href="salary.html">software engineer salary</a>.</p>
<p>Is software engineering engineering? What is engineering?</p>
<p>I summarized the <a href="smf.html">Standard MIDI file format</a>. I was thinking about making a digital audio workstation, but I changed my mind about music.</p>
<p>Here are some Java stuff. I used Java back in the days when I lacked self-respect. Now I recommend Prolog instead of Java.</p>
<p>&lt;2018-08-29&gt; For Java enterprise/server programming, I recommend Maven instead of Gradle.</p>

<p>The GC log is important. When your application is unexplainably slow, first look at the GC log: does GC take too much time? Look at the &quot;real&quot; time.</p>
<p>&lt;2018-10-28&gt; Systemd programmers are not competent enough for what they are doing.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Computers feel slow not because hardware sucks, but because programmers tell it to do stupid things. Ever-stronger hardware lets more programmers get away with writing ever-shittier software.</p>
<p>If software is a pure art, then its construction shouldn't be time-limited. A painter doesn't paint with deadlines. A painting is finished when the painter feels it's finished. However, a painter, when asked to paint a very specific painting, can estimate how many days it will take.</p>
<h3 id="farming"><span class="section_number">3.6</span><span class="section_title">Farming</span></h3>
<p>I thought about <a href="subsist.html">starting a farm in the middle of Jakarta</a>, but I put it on hold because I felt that the opportunity cost was too high.</p>
<p>The key to farming is to understand ecology, some botany (plant physiology and pathology), and nutrient cycle.</p>
<p>We should care more about phosphate run-off. Phosphates are vital and non-renewable, like fossil fuel. The bad news is that there is no cycle bringing back the phosphates from the sea to the land, unlike water with its hydrologic cycle.</p>
<h3 id="best-place-to-live"><span class="section_number">3.7</span><span class="section_title">Best place to live?</span></h3>
<p>According to &quot;The Economist&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, in 2018, Vienna is the most livable city, and it was Melbourne.</p>
<p>The United States of America seems to be the most powerful country on Earth. I thought America was liberal; it turns out to be socialist. Also, America has too much frivolous lawsuits<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
<p>How do we measure, perhaps indirectly, the <em>rationality</em> a country? That is, how do we measure how likely its people think critically? How do we know which people use their brains?</p>
<p>I am thinking about metrics that may correlate with the quality of life in a country. Among those metrics are immigration hardness, passport strength<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, tax rate<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>, press freedom index<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> (journalist imprisonment rate?), human freedom index (HFI)<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>, most liberal country ranking<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>. I think tax rate correlates with government size, and smaller government is better, but some high-tax-rate countries have good HFI.</p>
<p>New Zealand sounds promising. It has good HFI.</p>
<p>It seems that America has never killed or imprisoned journalists for criticizing people in power.</p>
<p>I think that the country that is the hardest to immigrate into<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> may be the best country on Earth. But I think those developed countries have their own problems.</p>
<p>A strong passport means that other countries believe that the issuer will not export bad people.</p>
<p>I think the solution to the refugee problem is not to take refugees, but to <em>fix the source country</em>, which must have become so messy that millions of people would rather die at sea than stay at home.</p>

<p>Nearsightedness (myopia) is reversible, but it takes years, as it also takes years for the eye to take that much damage.

<p>Crooked teeth can be fixed with orthotropics<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>, but it may take years, as orthodontics does anyway. The problem is that the modern human's jaw does not grow enough due to two reasons: (1) we don't chew soft modern foods as much as our ancestors chewed their hard foods, and (2) we have improper tongue posture. At first it is hard to understand what the tongue posture should be because we normally don't pay attention to our tongues, but I finally understand it. Orthotropics makes sense, but Mike Mew seems to have overstepped some boundaries unrelated to orthotropics.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> I understand that it is frustrating when you see something that others don't<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>, but you have to be patient, play the long game, and collect evidence.</p>

<h4 id="flat-earth-is-a-social-issue-not-a-scientific-issue"><span class="section_number">3.10.6</span><span class="section_title">Flat Earth is a social issue, not a scientific issue</span></h4>
<p>Flat-Earthers are merely looking for friends in this extremely power-unbalanced world. They have trust issues with authorities. I am also looking for friends who share my beliefs, and I also have trust issues with authorities, but the difference between a Flat-Earther and me is that I have trust issues with political authorities, whereas a Flat-Earther has a trust issue with scientific authorities. Thus, although I do not believe in Flat Earth, a Flat-Earther and I have more commonalities than differences. The same is true with Holocaust deniers and climate change deniers: it is a trust issue with some authorities.</p>
<p>How did such trust issues arise? Our parents, for good reason, taught us not to trust strangers. Thus it is a logical consequence that we don't trust authorities: they are strangers! We don't know who they are, and yet they suddenly come down telling us what is right and what is wrong.</p>
<p>How can two strangers be friends? By physical closeness (being at nearby location and time) and by mental closeness (having similar ideas and beliefs). How do we make sure that the people in power are not strangers? It is not feasible for one person to meet millions of people. Thus I have this corollary: <em>having power over more people always begets more trust issues</em>, simply because it is harder for the authority to not be strangers with its subjects. Perhaps it's just that power today is too centralized. But mass media enables centralization of power; the authority uses mass media to make its subjects feel that the authority is familiar. But mass communication is one-way communication. How does one-way communication build trust? In the same way an actor builds his fanbase of fans who trust him. First, the would-be fans have to fall in love with him from afar, be it due to his handsomeness, his charisma, or any aspect of him that resonates with them. But then this fanbase has to be maintained, and it is physically impossible for an actor with a million fans to be close to all of them. Therefore what is required to maintain the fanbase is a <em>mass illusion</em> of closeness: the actor has to behave in such a way that makes his fans <em>perceive</em> that he cares about <em>all</em> of them, whereas he can only <em>actually</em> care about <em>few</em> of them. The mass media only has to show the actor's interacting with <em>a few</em> of his fans, in order to make <em>all</em> of his fans feel that they have been interacted with. This is not because he is evil; he is just constrained by the laws of physics. This technique is a double-edged sword: it can be used to maintain political stability, but it can also be used to lie to millions of people. We need to teach people epistemology so that they can tell apart what they know and what they think they know. Mass media does not give any knowledge; it only gives an illusion of knowledge. Reading the news does not make us know anything; it only makes us think that we know. How do I know there is a disaster somewhere? I do not, because I can only know things near me, and it is not feasible for me to verify every claim in the news; I am merely assuming that the news is honest. Epistemology is more important than ever in this age of falsehood.</p>
<p>There are some simple experiments that we can carry out to determine the curvature of the Earth. Reality itself has told us through those experiments that the Earth is not flat; it is up to us to listen to reality or ignore it at our own peril. We will make costly mistakes if we make antennas and satellites with Flat Earth theory.</p>
<p>The theory makes sense and is a fine scientific theory: it is falsifiable. What does not make sense to me is the refusal to change one's beliefs despite being otherwise told by reality.</p>
