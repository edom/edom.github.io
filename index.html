<p>Who are engineers/scientists who have personal psychic experiences?<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> One of them is Alan Hugenot; where did he learn mediumship?</p>
<p>Russell Targ also has witnessed some psychic phenomena. His website<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> has some links<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Among those engineers/scientists, who have theories and experiments?</p>
<p>Gathering the engineers/scientists may speed up the next scientific revolution.</p>
<p>The theory does not have to be stated in terms of mainstream physics. The theory simply has to explain/predict some psychic aspects of reality, and we can marry the theory and mainstream physics later.</p>
<h3 id="on-funding-psychic-research"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; On funding psychic research</span></h3>
<p>While we wait for the old guards to die, we can ask the crowd to fund our psychic/paranormal research. It would be even better if we could force those old guards to retire early as they have become the very thing they sought to destroy in their youth. It seems that the way we do science in the 21st century corrupts open-minded youths into close-minded old guards. There is something wrong with the system. &quot;Publish or perish&quot; make people game citations. Proposals take too much effort to write and, even worse, the grants are awarded to &quot;safe-bet&quot; researches that have slim chance of discovering anything important.</p>
<p>Science is systematically broken; old guards have too much power; grants should be allocated in more varieties; people should not get too attached to theories. For faster development, science should be anarchistic. &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; leads to a dead end. Theoretical physicists should also identify and relax the simplifying assumptions, not just tinker with mathematics. Theoretical physics is not a branch of mathematics. Theoretical physics is a combination of philosophy and mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="current-research-in-consciousness"><span class="section_number">2.3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Current research in consciousness</span></h3>
<p>(On Desda Zuckerman's 2012 book &quot;Your Sacred Anatomy: An Owner's Guide To The Human Energy Structure&quot;.) Is &quot;spiritual anatomy&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> a theory of psychic functioning? It looks scientific: she did some tests, standardizations, and replications. It started from her observations. How good is its explanatory/predictive power?</p>
<p>People &quot;who are congenitally blind for organic reasons and have never been able to see anything in their entire lives can perceive the environment when their non-local consciousness detaches from their bodies during various life-threatening situations.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> If blind people can do that, then myopia should be a trivial obstacle.</p>
<p>What is the evidence for auras? What does Kirlian photography actually capture? Biofield evidence?<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>What is the evidence for chakras?</p>
<p><em>Why does all psychic development book boil down to deep meditation and visualization</em>? If they work, how do they work?</p>
<p>Are &quot;super psychic kids&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> real?</p>
<p>I am reading David DeBold's &quot;Miracle mastery&quot; book?</p>
<p>What are Paramahansa Yogananda's &quot;scientific techniques for attaining direct personal experience of God&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>?</p>
<p>Is the goal of null-domain meditation (empty-mind meditation) ego death?</p>
<p>Does an enlightened man know that he is enlightened? To be enlightened is to know reality directly without the material senses?</p>
<p>If an enlightened person cannot be disturbed<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, then what is the difference between enlightenment and apathy?</p>
<p>Some of the quickly visible effects of meditation are reduced stress and increased ability to maintain focus.</p>
<p>The depth of meditation can be subjectively measured by the <em>rate of internal distraction</em> (number of internal distractions per unit time). For example, a newbie meditator may be distracted 20 times per minute, and an expert meditator may be distracted 1 time per 15 minutes. One internal distraction is one time realizing that one has been distracted. External distraction does not always translate to internal distraction. For example, when someone talks to me while I am reading an article, I may fail to respond to the other person.</p>
<p>Is meditation about focus, about relaxation, or about quieting the mind?</p>
<p>Read Quora psychics-related topic, and perhaps Reddit, but Quora is more structured (question-answer).</p>
<p>Is Patanjali<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> right? Did he know what he was talking about?</p>
<p>Does myopia hamper aura-seeing? Do we use eyes to see aura? If not, then myopia should not hamper aura-seeing.</p>
<p>(On telekinesis and the conservation of energy.) Where does the energy come from? Does the practitioner become tired? Is energy conserved?</p>

<h3 id="the-immorality-of-companies-reflects-the-immorality-of-consumers"><span class="section_number">3.1</span><span class="section_title">The immorality of companies reflects the immorality of consumers</span></h3>
<p>Consumers are the masters of companies, because companies need money from consumers to live. Consumers are even more powerful than shareholders, because shareholders get their money from consumers too.</p>
<p>For example, Amazon's mission is &quot;to be Earth's most customer-centric company&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. If consumers want cheap things fast, then so be it, workers be damned.</p>
<p>Profit is a feedback signal that indicates that the company is doing what consumers want. Thus, if we buy from Amazon because it is cheaper, we are voting for getting workers to do maximum work with minimum pay; otherwise our things wouldn't be as cheap and fast as they are today.</p>
<p>If consumers want food to be delivered to their houses, then so be it, environment be damned.</p>
<p>If consumers want new stuff every year, then so be it, environment be damned.</p>
<p>Companies are not the only ones to blame; all of us are to blame for having endless desires.</p>
<p>Everytime we buy something, we make a moral judgement, even if we don't realize it.</p>
<p>Companies are simply doing what the consumers want. If the consumers want cheap things, then so be it, workers and environment be damned. Thus, the immorality of companies reflects the immorality of consumers.</p>
<p>We often buy something without caring about how it is made. We turn a blind eye to the immorality of producing that thing.</p>
<p>The consumer's beliefs determine the company's behavior.</p>
<p>Buying from immoral companies means <em>voting for immoral behavior</em>.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-care"><span class="section_number">3.2</span><span class="section_title">How can we care?</span></h3>
<p>It seems impractical for one person to check every building, every mine, and every employee of all companies.</p>
<p>We establish an organization that summarizes the immorality of companies so concisely that consumers can easily act on that report. We must establish a moral police for policing the morality of companies.</p>
<p>Consumers must unite, prefer, and demand moral companies.</p>
<p>In 2019, I define the adjective &quot;moral&quot; to mean &quot;not detrimental to the survival of the human race&quot; (my moral system in 2019 is natural morality), but you can define &quot;moral&quot; to mean anything that suits your moral system. For example, if you follow Jesus, then you may define &quot;moral&quot; to mean &quot;that would not be disapproved by Jesus&quot;.</p>
<p>To survive, we have to both think and feel.</p>
<p>To change the world, we must first change ourselves.</p>

<p>How are foods going to be delivered to our houses if not with plastic packaging? The only alternative is to move the people instead of moving the food, but aren't we all too lazy to walk to the restaurant?</p>
<p>How are we going to get electricity?</p>
<p>What if we need something that is produced by a monopoly with high barrier to entry?</p>
<p>Boycott the company, and put our lifestyle down a notch?</p>
<p>We can always choose to not buy (and perhaps suffer or die).</p>
<p>We can always kill ourselves, although we usually won't.</p>
<p>The crisis is a question to us: Which do we prefer: much convenience but much environmental destruction, or some inconvenience but slight environmental destruction?</p>

<p>I find it easier to define &quot;program&quot; than to define &quot;software&quot;.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should focus on <em>programs</em> instead of software. We can talk about computer programs without talking about software. After all, Tukey 1958 intended &quot;software&quot; to mean computer programs.</p>

<p>Our &quot;computer science&quot; label has misled people into thinking that we can fix their computers.</p>
<p>Although the first computer scientists did study computers, computer scientists now don't study computers anymore because software has grown too big; now computer scientists study mostly software, and the hardware is supposed to be studied by <em>computer engineers</em>.</p>
<p>A honestly-named computer-science student should study both hardware and software because a computer has a hardware part and a software part, But, in fact, a computer-science student studies much more software than hardware, and will often work with software while taking hardware for granted in their jobs.</p>
<p>Perhaps universities should also merge law departments and computer science departments into <em>software departments</em>.</p>
<p>On second thought, perhaps we should not call ourselves &quot;software scientists&quot; because we don't even know what software is. Perhaps we should just call ourselves &quot;computer programmers&quot;.</p>

<h4 id="a-direction-for-software-engineering"><span class="section_number">4.7.1</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-08-27&gt; A direction for software engineering</span></h4>
<p>Two things have to be addressed in software engineering: the lack of <em>science</em>, and the lack of <em>tools</em>.</p>
<p><em>Software engineering lacks an underlying branch of science</em>. Remember that engineering is an application of science</p>
<p><em>Software engineering lacks tools.</em> Building an enterprise application with Java is like building a 20-story building with only shovel.</p>
<p>One of those tools is a <em>whole-system programming language</em> with support for <em>persistent states</em> (that outlive one run of the application). Every time the program starts, it has to <em>initialize</em> all persistent states that are not already initialized. A software system is not only the program, but also the database, the files, the documentation, etc. Current programming languages focus too much on the application and not on the <em>whole system</em>. We need a language that can also capture the persistent states.</p>
<h4 id="software-engineers-need-better-tools"><span class="section_number">4.7.2</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-08-23&gt; Software engineers need better tools</span></h4>
<p>We want to build a skyscraper, but all we have is a spade.</p>
<p>Java is too low level for making business applications.</p>
<h4 id="software-structural-engineering"><span class="section_number">4.7.3</span><span class="section_title">Software structural engineering</span></h4>
<p>&lt;2019-08-15&gt;</p>
<p>Here we transplant <em>civil structural engineering</em> to <em>software structural engineering</em> by analogy.</p>
<p>Both civil structural engineers and software structural engineers do <em>capacity planning</em> and <em>load testing</em>.</p>
<p>Civil structural engineers deal with the <em>strength of materials</em>, whereas software structural engineers deal with the <em>emptying rate of queues</em>.</p>
<p>The science of civil structural engineering is based on <em>continuum mechanics</em>, whereas the science of software structural engineering is based on <em>queuing theory</em>.</p>
<p>Material breakage is analogous to <em>full queue</em>.</p>
<p>When a civil structure fails, the <em>building</em> collapses. When a software structure fails, the <em>system performance</em> collapses: latency skyrockets and throughput drops.</p>
<p>Structural engineers design structures to <em>withstand probable adversities</em> according to cost-benefit analysis. Civil structural engineers design structures to withstand <em>heat, wind, earthquakes, etc.</em> Software structural engineers design systems to withstand <em>load spikes, network disruptions, disk failures, etc.</em> If we are building a skyscraper in an earthquake-prone region, we must seriously consider earthquakes. If we are building a system for 1,000,000 concurrent users, we must seriously consider traffic spikes, network disruptions, and other adversities. If we are merely building a system with 10,000 lines of code for 10 users, and it will stay that way for 100 years, then it is a waste of resources to bake in a grandiose architecture. If you need a shack, and it will satisfy you for 1,000 years, then perhaps don't build a skyscraper.</p>

<p>We can assume that humans implement these primitive operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, and division, for small numbers below ten, rounding, comparison.</p>
<p>Any average person could execute such an algorithm, because it is <em>unambiguous</em> and is built on common primitive operations.</p>
<p>All those primitive operations also happens to be implementable in electronic computers. That is, electronic computers can do some human operations.</p>

<p>There are two languages: the <em>host</em> language and the <em>guest</em> language. In linguistics, they are called the <em>meta</em>-language<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and the <em>object</em> language, respectively. For example, when we teach German to someone who only knows English, we use English as the host language and German as the guest language.</p>
<p>We can borrow the host language's concrete syntax, so that we can reuse <code>read-syntax</code>, but specify different semantics, with an interpretation function.</p>
<p>We can borrow the host language's semantics.</p>

<p>AWS RDS PostgreSQL point-in-time recovery (PITR) does not always work.</p>

<p>Always routinely test the restorability of your backups.</p>
<p>In a company with 50 engineers, there is one potentially business-ending accident per year, like an accidental deletion of a production database.</p>
<p>A good system is not designed by wishing that people are smart. Scripts have shitty user interfaces. Smart people make mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, accidents do happen elsewhere in the cloud.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Joyent, Heroku, AWS, Gitlab. Accidental reboots.

<p>&quot;I don't like the <em>guy's</em> wearing green pants&quot; means you don't like <em>what he does</em>: wearing green pants. You don't have a personal problem with the guy, but you think he shouldn't wear green pants.

<p>Abortion is not a moral issue. It is a <em>linguistic</em> issue.</p>
<p>The root problem of the abortion issue is the non-existence of the definition of &quot;human&quot;.</p>
<p>The question &quot;Should we allow abortion?&quot; actually reads &quot;What is a human?&quot;</p>
<p>It is crazy that people can talk and shout for hours without agreeing on the meaning of the words that they use. It is exactly like watching someone who understands only Chinese argue with someone who understands only English: No communication happens, only noise and gestures of frustration.</p>
<p>My suggestion is: Before everyone agrees on the same definition of &quot;human&quot;, avoid wasting time in abortion &quot;debates&quot;. No communication happens when people interpret words differently.</p>
<p>What is a human? Nobody can satisfactorily define what a &quot;human&quot; is; they only &quot;know it when they see it&quot;. For every &quot;definition&quot; of human you come up with, I can point out a problem with it. I have tried to define &quot;human&quot; a few times, and failed.</p>
<p>The same goes for &quot;baby&quot; and &quot;fetus&quot;.</p>
<p>Where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>This problem has a name: sorites paradox<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> (that is, paradox of the heap).</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn't know the sorites paradox has no business talking about abortion.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that every statement is either false or true has no business talking about abortion. In reality, every statement can be anywhere between 0 percent true and 100 percent true.</p>
<p>Outlawing abortion now causes increased crime rate 20 years later.</p>
<p>Outlawing abortion is condemning rape victims into living hell.</p>
<p>Outlawing abortion saves some present lives but harms even more future lives.</p>
<p>People reject abortion not because abortion is bad, but because <em>they believe</em> abortion is bad, and thus rejecting abortion makes them feel noble. They cannot distinguish between &quot;X is true&quot; and &quot;I believe X is true&quot;. Their reasoning is deficient.</p>
<p>People have been having abortions since time immemorial. Why does it become a problem only recently?</p>
<p>Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it should be illegal.</p>
<p>But the state should also not always be utilitarian.</p>
<p>I think it is dishonest to call our species <em>Homo sapiens</em>, the wise ones. I think it's more honest to call our species <em>Homo homicidalis</em>, that is, the ones who like to kill their own kind. I think we can admit that we have some people we'd like to kill; we just don't do it because we're afraid of the cops.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-17&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>appeal-to-evolution</em> is this argument: <em>If a trait would hamper the survival of a species, then that species would not have evolved that trait.</em></p>
<p>It is a heuristic. It is not always correct. For example, it cannot explain peacock tails. However, it seems reasonable in absence of other information.</p>
<p>The appeal-to-evolution weakens the theory that irregular eating causes gastritis as follows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very early hunter-gatherer humans ate irregularly; they were always a few days away from starvation, they did not have a secure food supply, they depend very much on their surroundings. <em>Having gastritis due to irregular eating would hamper their survival.</em> Therefore they probably evolved such that irregular eating does not cause gastritis.</p>

<p>Conservation of mass.</p>
<p>Body mass is gained by food and drinks, and lost by exhalation and excretion.</p>
<p>The question is the <em>composition</em> of those mass.</p>
<p>If I weigh 70 kg and both my legs weigh 20 kg, then a squat consumes at least 50 kg * 10 m/s2 * 0.5 m = 200 J = 0.0478 kcal. That's a tiny amount relative to the calories in the food we eat! We can easily eat 300 kcal in one meal. Thus, if the human body were 100% efficient, I would have to squat <em>6,276 times</em> to burn that one meal!</p>
<p>Thus the biggest energy consumer is the basal metabolic processes.</p>
<p>The proximal cause is the combination of nutrition and hormones. Hormones are affected by nutrition, activity, and genetics.</p>

<p>Although the game never explicitly instructs players about what things would kill Crash, players seem to have an <em>instinct</em> or <em>intuition</em> about such things. For example, animals, traps, fires, and falling would kill Crash. Players seem to <em>just know</em> how to play the game. But that is only because the dangerous things in the game world <em>correspond</em> to dangerous things in the real world; thus players <em>already know</em>. It seems that <em>most</em> adult humans know <em>some</em> ways of avoiding death: If doing something kills you, then simply don't do it.</p>

<p>There are psychological experiments and theories that try to explain those experiments, but do those theories predict anything?</p>
<p>Is psychology falsifiable?</p>
<p>There are some interesting experiments and applications. Asch conformity experiment, Stanford prison experiment. Using stories to change minds. Hostage negotiation techniques. Pavlovian conditioning, Skinnerian conditioning. Rat heaven experiment. Monkey mother experiment. <em>But what is the underlying science?</em> Biology, genetics, hormones, epigenetics, neuroscience, and so on.</p>
<p>Psychology can be thought of as applied biology.</p>
<p>Everyone capable of some empathy has an intuitive understanding of basic psychology.</p>

<p>Combine <em>nutrition science</em> and <em>psychology</em>.</p>
<p>For two weeks.</p>
<p>Pay attention to gut microbiome.</p>
<p>No sugar; no condiments bought from supermarket because they all have sugar. No flour. No carb. No food that is processed more than one step from its original form. No refined foods. No extracts. Sugar is not OK because it is concentrated sugarcane plant extract. Cooked meat is very OK, but sausage is not. White rice is not OK. Green vegetables OK.</p>
<p>Anytime you're hungry, just eat; there is no time restriction; the only restriction is that you eat real fat/protein.</p>
<p>Everytime you eat, you must send a photograph of what you eat to me. It is not for approval, but for commentary, and for <em>psychology</em>, for accountability, so that you feel that you are doing it for me, so that you don't prematurely abandon your effort.</p>

<p>2016-11-29 it went down.</p>
<p>2016-12-13 it went down due to someone else's fault. Kabel kecangkul alat berat orang lain di depan BCA KCP Kepa Duri Jl Mangga.</p>
<p>2017-06-15 00:00 +0700 it went down. 04:00 I went to bed, and it was still down. It went up again some time between 04:00 and 10:30. The downtime was more than 4 hours.</p>

<p>2017-10-09 11:00 +0700 it went down. They said it would go up on 2017-10-10 23:00 +0700 (24 hour downtime). 2017-10-10 03:23 +0700 it hadn't gone up. It finally went up, but I didn't note when.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-10-30&gt; Update: Hal-hal di bawah sudah tidak berlaku. Pada tahun 2019, Grab lebih bagus daripada Gojek. Akhirnya saya kembali pakai Grab.</p>
<p>&lt;2018-09-22&gt;</p>
<p>Saya sempat coba Grab dan Gojek. Saya tidak pakai Grab karena saya benci kode promo. Akhirnya berlabuh di Gojek.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gojek
<ul>
<li>Kadang pengemudi tidak bisa membaca. Tiap minggu ada saja pengemudi yang tidak baca catatan, lalu nyasar. Sangat buang waktu.</li>
<li>Kadang dapat motor Yamaha Aerox.
<ul>
<li>Motor ini tidak aman; pusat massa tinggi, mengurangi kestabilan.</li>
<li>Motor ini tidak nyaman; joknya keras, suspensinya keras, menyiksa pantat.</li>
<li>Contoh motor yang enak: Honda Scoopy. Tampilannya emang culun, tapi jok lebar dan empuk, dan suspensi juga lembut. Enak buat pantat.</li>
<li>(Saya tidak punya motor. Saya bukan fans Yamaha ataupun Honda. Saya cuma benci sakit pantat.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kadang ban kempes. Kadang motor bocor. Kadang ban bocor.</li>
<li>Pernah, jam 17:00, 30 menit gak ada yang ambil.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gocar
<ul>
<li>Kadang pengemudi mengantuk, merem melek. Mobil ngegas ngerem.</li>
<li>Posisi suka ngaco. Minta jemput di S Parman, supir di Mal Pondok Indah lah (12 km), di Pejompongan lah (6 km), di Tomang lah (4 km), di sisi jalan yang salah lah (4 km).</li>
<li>Kadang di-cancel 5 kali baru dapat.</li>
<li>Kadang mobil bau rokok.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grabbike
<ul>
<li>&lt;2018-10-05&gt; Grab jam 17 sangat shitty. Driver tidak bisa dihubungi. Dua kali berturut-turut.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grabcar
<ul>
<li>&lt;2018-10-25&gt; Saya ditinggal kabur supir grabcar, padahal saya tinggal 5 langkah dari mobil, dan dia belum ada 5 menit menunggu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aplikasi Gojek vs Grab:
<ul>
<li>Grab lebih reliable.</li>
<li>Gojek lebih hemat baterai.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perasaan saya.
<ul>
<li>Teknologi keduanya shitty, tapi teknologi Grab less shitty daripada teknologi Gojek; Grabcar lebih bisa mencari supir yang dekat (500 m, 1 km); Gocar seringkali dapat supir (2 km, bahkan pernah 6 km).</li>
<li>Supir Gocar memperlakukan penumpang lebih baik daripada supir Grabcar memperlakukan penumpang. Mungkin karena Gojek lebih kejam ke supir.</li>

<p>At 20 years old, we are friends because we are in the same company. We stop being friends as soon as we resign.</p>
<p>At 30 years, we are friends because we share a goal or hobby or problem, because we care about a common thing. We stop being friends as soon as our problem is solved.</p>

<p>May these musical pieces be of some consolation to fellow doomers.</p>
<p>&quot;Oblivion&quot;, by Astor Piazzolla.</p>
<p>&quot;Can't say goodbye to yesterday&quot;, by Rika Muranaka, sung by Carla White.</p>
<p>These two songs are American songs with lush orchestral background.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterdays&quot;, sung by Ella Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>&quot;My romance&quot;, Mel Tormé. Mel's suave light voice and the lush orchestral background.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday&quot;, The Beatles.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday when I was young&quot;, sung by Matt Monro.</p>
<p>&quot;Fragile&quot;, by Sting.</p>
<p>&quot;Gabriel's Oboe&quot;, by Ennio Morricone.</p>
<p>&quot;Lacrimosa&quot;, from &quot;Requiem&quot;, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.</p>
<p>&quot;Seacht suáilcí na Maighdine Muire&quot;, Aoife Ní Fhearraigh.</p>
<p>&quot;The best is yet to come&quot;, by Rika Muranaka, sung by Aoife Ní Fhearraigh.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry seems to be the hardest word&quot;, Blue featuring Elton John.</p>
<p>&quot;God rest you merry gentlemen&quot;. For this song, I prefer the Aeolian mode, some inverted chords, a tempo of about 60 bpm, and a conservative solemn arrangement that does not try too hard to impress the listener. There is also Annie Lennox's interesting arrangement, although I would prefer its harmony to be in Aeolian mode.</p>
<p>&quot;My way&quot;, Elvis Presley.</p>
<p>&quot;End of the world&quot;, Aphrodite's Child.</p>
<h4 id="to-float-in-the-ocean-of-doom"><span class="section_number">11.10.2</span><span class="section_title">To float in the ocean of doom</span></h4>
<p>These are a little upbeat.</p>
<p>But no matter how hard one tries, one eventually sinks into the ocean of doom, into eternal oblivion, into the nothingness that he came from.</p>
<p>&quot;The unsung war&quot;, Ace Combat 5.</p>
<p>&quot;Liberation of Gracemeria&quot;, Ace Combat 6. An interesting rhythmic invention; that syncopated ostinato is genius. It still feels satisfying even after many replays.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow me&quot;, Pat Metheny.</p>
<p>&quot;Fairy tales&quot;, Anita Baker.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you real?&quot;, Art Blakey &amp; The Jazz Messengers.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm Mr Jody&quot;, Marvin Sease.</p>
<p>&quot;All rise&quot;, Blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Asman&quot;, Gulnur Satylganova.</p>
<p>&quot;Wakare no yokan&quot;, Teresa Teng.</p>
<p>&quot;Toki wo kakeru shoujo&quot;, Harada Tomoyo.</p>
<p>The NAAFP (National Association for the Advancement of Fat People) anthem from Family Guy. Beautiful harmony. I love the IV-III7-vi progression (in the &quot;god's man-boobs are flabby and they hurt when he jogs&quot; part).</p>
<p>Movement 1 of BWV 1052 (Harpsichord concerto in D minor), Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>Russian national anthem.</p>

<p>Ignoring humidity, we want to cool 10x3x3 = 90 m3 of air from 33 deg C to 27 deg C using ice blocks.</p>
<p>Assume that the heat capacity of air is 0.001 J / cm3 / K = 1 MJ / m3 / K <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities</a></p>
<p>Thus we have to remove 90 m3 * 6 K * 1 MJ / m3 / K = 540 MJ of heat from the air in the room.</p>
<p>Some thermal conductivity parameters at 1 bar in watt per meter per kelvin</p>
<h3 id="on-the-nuclear-option"><span class="section_number">12.2</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-08-27&gt; On the nuclear option</span></h3>
<p>There have been several nuke-related ideas: Nuke <em>subduction plates</em> to prevent big earthquakes; Nuke <em>hurricanes</em> to stop them<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>; Nuke <em>asteroids</em> to prevent them from crashing into Earth. But they all suffer from one problem: The nuke we have in 2019 is too weak for those purposes.</p>
<p>&lt;2019-08-19&gt; Idea: Explode atomic bombs at subduction plates to prevent bigger earthquakes. Won't work<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>But isn't it just a matter of making bigger bombs? It is possible in principle. We can leave it to the engineers; it's just a matter of time before they build a bomb big enough to move subduction plates.</p>
<p>It reminds me of George Carlin's saying: &quot;The planet is fine. The people are fucked.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is there no professor search engine? Why is there no Semantic Web ontology for research interests?

<p>I am an independent<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> researcher from Indonesia, with too many interests, mostly theoretical, because theoretical research is low-cost and can be done at home<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a>, because I don't have the resources for experimental research. Most of my writings involve applied analytic philosophy, mathematics, and computers. (Applied analytic philosophy is the careful usage of words to discover the essence of things.)</p>
<p>My last formal education degree, if you care, is a Sarjana Ilmu Komputer<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> degree bestowed in 2011 by the Fakultas Ilmu Komputer<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> of Universitas Indonesia<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> for four years of undergraduate education.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-trust-you"><span class="section_number">14.3</span><span class="section_title">Should I trust you?</span></h3>
<p><em>No, you should not.</em> Anyone can put anything on the Internet. Judge for yourself. More disclaimers follow.</p>
<p><em>I may err.</em> Read cautiously. Compare with other independent sources. Do not trust me without thinking for yourself. Use your own judgement.</p>
<p><em>I am not responsible for what other people write in their comments,</em> but I can remove comments from my website. People are free to say whatever they want, and people are free to disagree with whatever others say, as long as they do that in a civilized manner.</p>
<p><em>I may change.</em> I am not attached to our beliefs. Things I wrote in the past should not be solely used to judge my present self.</p>
<p>Most pages are messy drafts. URLs may change.</p>
<p>If you have good eyesight, you may want to zoom out by pressing Control-minus. The fonts may be too big.</p>
<h3 id="how-should-i-interact-with-you"><span class="section_number">14.4</span><span class="section_title">How should I interact with you?</span></h3>
<p>You can pick one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave a Disqus comment in the related page.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/edom/edom.github.io/issues">Open an issue at GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect long delay. If you don't get a reply after waiting for a few days, try resending your message. It does get lost sometimes.</p>
<p>If you are in Jakarta, we may meet in some meetups.</p>
<h3 id="where-else-are-you"><span class="section_number">14.5</span><span class="section_title">Where else are you?</span></h3>

<p>These are some websites similar to this website and their differences.</p>
<p><a href="https://kevinbinz.com/">kevinbinz.com</a> is more like a blog than a wiki.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">en.wikipedia.org</a> does not want original content.

<p>TheBrain: the idea is good, but the app is slower than static web.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org">brainpickings.org</a>: too social, too much content, too little navigation, too little structure; pop science content is too much pop and too little science.</p>

<p>Korban memakai narkoba karena terisolasi secara sosial (merasa kesepian).</p>
<p>Penjara tidak menyelesaikan apapun.</p>
<p>Penjara adalah masalah, bukan solusi.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-15&gt;</p>
<p>In 2019, anyone who thinks that guns can protect them from tyrannical governments is deluded. Governments have better guns, soldiers, cops, bombs, planes, drones, tanks, nukes, and a monopoly on violence bigger than ever in history. Nevertheless, guns can be used to terrorize government employees to discourage people from working for the government,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> but I don't recommend that, and I don't plan to discuss asymmetric warfare<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> and militant anarchism here.</p>
<p>Thus the only reason left for gun rights is to let people sell guns for profit.</p>
<h4 id="constitutions-are-not-holy-books"><span class="section_number">15.6.2</span><span class="section_title">Constitutions are not holy books</span></h4>
<p>&lt;2019-08-16&gt;</p>
<p>Changing constitutions is almost as hard as changing bibles. Constitutions have become holy books, and political ideologies have become religions. Blind beliefs are bad for progress.</p>
<p>Constitutions should be hard to change, because it is the foundation of all other laws in a country. A constitution that changes often will confuse everyone. Unfortunately, this also means that a bad constitution will stay bad forever.</p>

<p>Customs officials can make their own laws because they face no consequences: There is no practical way to hold them accountable for their actions. Also, people don't care.</p>
<p>Before we blame border patrol, we should try to empathize. Are they underpaid? Are they at risk? Is their job dehumanizing or demoralizing? Have we allocated them enough resources necessary for their job? Is the system broken?</p></li>

<h4 id="is-freedom-of-speech-important"><span class="section_number">15.6.10</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-07-06&gt; Is freedom of speech important?</span></h4>
<p>Examples of degrees of freedom of speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>In USA and Canada, you can talk shit about the government, as long as you don't make death threats, or the cops will get you.</li>
<li>In Indonesia, you can disagree with the government, but you have to do it very politely, or you will be jailed.</li>
<li>In China, if you disagree with the government, your will be encumbered, if not killed.</li>
<li>In Saudi Arabia, if you disagree with the government, you will be killed.</li>
</ul>
<p>But all government is more similar than different: There is always centralization of power, and therefore abuse of power.</p>
<p>Without freedom of speech, life goes on pretty much normally in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the USA, for all its free speech, still has problems like crony capitalism and highest gun-related murder which is totally preventable as shown by the Australians.</p>
<p>Why do you insist on owning a gun? It does not protect you from a tyrannical government. They have bombs, armies, nukes, soldiers, cops, gunboats, aircrafts, hackers, money, what else. If you think your teeny-pistol militia can beat them, you're as deluded as Don Quixote; but actually he has better chances than you do, because windmills don't fight back, whereas governments do. The freedom to bear arms is just a ceremonial distraction from more important issues such as imperialism, privacy, and borders.</p>

<p>I trust engineers and scientists, but I don't trust companies. If a nuclear power plant is run by a company, it is just a matter of time before someone in management cuts costs for short-term profit, skimps on something, dismisses the engineers, and causes an accident. It has happened with airplanes (such as Boeing 737 MAX, they cut corners because they were competing with Airbus), nuclear fission power plants (such as TEPCO Fukushima, they ignored an engineer's concern about the backup pump's vulnerability to giant tsunami).</p>
<p>When you ignore an engineer, a disaster will happen, and you will bear a much higher cost than what would cost you if you just did what the engineer told you to do. Disrespecting engineers and scientists is disrespecting Nature, and <em>Nature does not care about your profits.</em></p>

<h4 id="fairtube-and-renaming-advertising"><span class="section_number">15.6.20</span><span class="section_title">FairTube, and renaming &quot;advertising&quot;</span></h4>
<p>I hope FairTube wins, but the root cause of the problem is that today's &quot;advertising&quot; is about <em>making people buy</em>, by psychological manipulation, by all means, at all costs; whereas the original 15th century meaning of &quot;to advertise&quot; is to &quot;give notice to others&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a>. There was no sense of persuasion in the 15th-century advertising.</p>
<p>In 2019, &quot;advertising&quot; is about manipulating people into buying things, by all means not forbidden by law. Thus what we call &quot;advertising&quot; now, we should call &quot;for-profit psychological manipulation&quot;.</p>

<p>Incentivizing police to catch people is extremely dangerous; I'd rather have police not work than have them eagerly incriminate people.</p>
<p>Police should not be rewarded for making arrests. Police should not be rewarded for successful trials.</p>
<h4 id="on-modern-monetary-theory-taxes-incentives-behaviors"><span class="section_number">15.6.22</span><span class="section_title">On modern monetary theory, taxes, incentives, behaviors</span></h4>
<p>We should think of <em>taxes</em> as a way for <em>incentivizing</em> behaviors, <em>not</em> for <em>funding</em> government programs. The government can just create money out of nothing, as long as the money creation rate does not exceed the real economic growth rate. Indeed, right now, banks are creating money out of nothing, in the form of loans, and these virtual numbers can have real effects on prices: If, at the same time, one million people get loans and buy cars, then there will be a short-term shortage of cars (demand surge), and producers may decide to increase production or raise prices or both if the surge persists.</p>
<p>But what if the real economy is shrinking?</p>

<p>The amount is not important, but should be low, but not zero. What is important is that an entrance fee <em>exists</em>.</p>
<p>When a surgeon fails, he injures one people. When a car driver fails, he injures ten people. When a lawmaker fails, he injures millions of people. Then why do we insist on lower standards for our lawmakers than for our surgeons? Why do we elect clueless clowns and self-enriching thiefs into the government? <em>Because we pay for a surgery but not for an election</em>. Paying for something increases our expectation. We don't pay for an election, so we expect nothing.</p>
<p>But companies do pay for elections, through contributions and lobbyings. Thus companies expect to gain from elections, while people don't.</p>

<p>These entities may have done things that would be considered atrocities by 2019 standards: Muhammad<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a>, Suharto<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a>, the United States of America<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a>, the British Empire<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a>, many imperialist European countries, Mao<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a>, Stalin<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a>, Hitler<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a>, Genghis Khan, and many more<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a>, if not everyone.</p>
<p><em>But only Hitler lost the war.</em></p>
<p>Thus now Hitler is condemned, whereas the others are venerated.</p>
<p>It is a crime to murder one person. It is not a crime to wage an unjust war <em>and win the war</em> because the winner gets to define what &quot;crime&quot; is, and then he gets to write the history. This is just human nature. Even I myself suffer from that: I often find myself imagining the killing of billions of people, be it by my own hands or by a natural catastrophe, and I imagine the peace that follows, the problems that disappear, the overcrowding gone, the pollution gone, the noise-makers gone, the exorbitant land prices fall.</p>
<p>There is no government for countries, and thus countries go to war against other countries. At the level of citizens, there is a rule of law, but at the level of countries, it is anarchy. Thus it seems that there has to be a government for governments, but this suffers from infinite regress: second-level governments may go to war with each other, and so on. Thus, the only way to global peace is <em>to have exactly one government for all people</em>, one World Government, because it is impossible to have a war if there is nobody else to wage a war against, that is, if you are the only government in the world. This is the only way to prevent wars.</p>
<p>This World Government should be filled with scientists and engineers because they do politics better than politicians do; see China<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a>, but it's changing in 2017.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>But people are too chauvinistic, too egoistic, and too proud for a World Government. All nationalism is chauvinism, because we are all citizens of the Earth. As technology is heading toward a singularity, human culture is also heading toward a singularity.</p>
<p>Having different governments also enables tax avoidance, money laundering, and wage slavery, by enabling one to arbitrage different regulations in different countries.</p>
<h4 id="people-not-beliefs-deserve-respect"><span class="section_number">15.7.3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-08-14&gt; People, not beliefs, deserve respect</span></h4>
<p>We can respectfully treat people who believe unjustifiable things such as religions, superstitions, but we should not respect their beliefs. If we facilitate some people with stupid beliefs, it is not because we respect their beliefs, but because we respect their feelings.</p>
<p>But this is impractical. People interpret attacks on their beliefs as attacks on their selves.</p>
<p>Not all opinions are equal:</p>

<li>If you have a surgery, you want an expert surgeon.</li>
<li>If you have a concert, you want an expert musicians.</li>
<li>Why then, when it comes to Brexit, do people suddently think they are expert politicians?

<li>The people voting for Brexit might not even understand what the European Union is.</li>

<h4 id="common-law-is-more-agile-than-civil-law"><span class="section_number">15.7.4</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-08-20&gt; Common law is more agile than civil law</span></h4>
<p>Civil law is always late, because we suck at foretelling. In civil law, everything is legal until legislators make a law against it.</p>
<p>But common law requires higher standards for judges, whereas judges are fallible humans too, just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Humans are not computers. Humans excel at following the <em>spirit</em> of the law. Computers excel at following the <em>letter</em> of the law. Indeed humans who strictly follow the letter of the law may be malicious.</p>
<p>Lawmakers should make principles, not rules. Lawmakers should explicitly state the spirit and intention of the law, not just the letter of the law.</p>
<h4 id="growing-food-is-the-best-solution-to-poverty"><span class="section_number">15.7.5</span><span class="section_title">Growing food is the best solution to poverty</span></h4>
<p>Growing food is the only sane way to lift many people out of poverty, because <em>Nature pays everyone who works</em>.</p>
<p>It reduces unemployment, poverty, homelessness, crime.</p>
<p>Example<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>A scalable solution to poverty?</p>
<ol>
<li>Relocate poor people to fertile land that is unused but not too far from civilization; give each family 100 square meters.</li>
<li>Help them grow food; educate and train them. Pay attention to ecology, and close the nutrient cycle.</li>
<li>Help them sell their production.</li>
</ol>
<p>This simultaneously solves hunger, poverty, homelessness, overcrowding, and crime.</p>
<p>This reduces agricultural failure risk: More small farms distributed geographically means we have more backups to a regional catastrophe.</p>

<p>A perverse situation may arise, in which the individual is praised for success, but the group is blamed for faults, perhaps due to our desire to feel good and avoid conflicts. An example of such perverse situation is the belief &quot;If this country advances, it's due to the president; if this country regresses, it's due to the government&quot;, or &quot;If this company profits, it's due to the director; if the company loses, it's due to everyone&quot;.</p>

<h3 id="core-beliefs"><span class="section_number">15.12</span><span class="section_title">Core beliefs</span></h3>
<p>If a belief conflicts with reality, then the belief must change.</p>
<p>We define &quot;good&quot; as &quot;promoting the survival of the human species&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Nationalism is collective egoism.</em> There should be only one government on Earth, and it should be The Only World Government, because otherwise governments will fight each other due to national egoism.</p>
<p>We prefer to be <em>sober</em> and savor every moment of our lives. The only time we use consciousness-altering drugs is in great pain, such as in surgeries or in terminal illnesses. We do not drink alcohol to the point of intoxication.</p>
<p><em>We hate smoke</em>: cigarettes, vapes, you name it, we hate it. We do not smoke.</p>
<p><em>We hate perfumes.</em> We prefer no odor at all. We prefer slight natural body odor to perfumes.</p>
<p>We think a little dandruff and a little body odor is normal.</p>
<p>We treat most bacteria as essential, not as things to be eradicated. We only use antibiotics if it is the only way to save us from death.</p>
<p>We do not want to change the status quo for the sake of change without reason. Disruption is not something to be proud of. Every change has unintended consequences.</p>
<p>We prefer <em>sustainability</em> to growth.</p>
<p><em>Leisure</em> is noble and there is nothing shameful about wanting leisure, seeking sustainability, and shunning gratuitous growth.</p>
<p><em>Pension is robbing the young to pay the old.</em> It assumes that the population pyramid will always have a certain shape. It is not sustainable.</p>

<p>Everything is trading: Buy low, sell high.</p>
<p>Hiring is trading too. Buy labor cheap, sell products high.</p>
<p>Labor has maintenance costs, just like machines. Skimp on machine maintenance, they break down. Skimp on labor maintenance, they resign, or worse, they riot, or even worse, they unionize.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://evonomics.com/role-of-morality-in-a-capitalist-economy/">https://evonomics.com/role-of-morality-in-a-capitalist-economy/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, what do you mean social good? In economics and evolution we have a well-defined concept of public goods. Production of public goods is individually costly, while benefits are shared among all. I think you see where I am going. As we all know, selfish agents will never cooperate to produce costly public goods. I think this mathematical result should have the status of “the fundamental theorem of social sciences.”</p>

<h3 id="seek-wealth-not-money"><span class="section_number">15.15</span><span class="section_title">Seek wealth, not money</span></h3>
<p>If one wants to be rich, then one should seek wealth, not money. One should always know that money is only a proxy of wealth, and the conversion of money to wealth always depends on who is willing to accept that money.</p>
<h3 id="anarchy-selfishness-institutions"><span class="section_number">15.16</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-10-28&gt; Anarchy, selfishness, institutions</span></h3>
<p>Humanity should not try anarchy before humanity can overcome its own selfishness.</p>
<p>Anarchy cannot work with selfish people.</p>
<p>Capitalism is the system for making selfish people help others.</p>
<p>Capitalism assumes the least of humans. Capitalism does not assume that people are good.</p>
<p>If humans were not selfish, anarchy would work much better than capitalism did.</p>
<p>Often we do not have the luxury of assuming that people are good.</p>
<p>But the total wealth in the 21st century is much higher than the total wealth in the 20th century.</p>
<p><em>Can humanity accomplish great things without institutions?</em></p>
<p>Even without formal institutions, there will be de-facto makeshift institutions headed by experts who know what to do, established by people who have power.</p>
<p>Institution is one way of doing something that takes more than the lifespan of one human.</p>
<p>Institutions suck, but perhaps they are better than the natural state of man that is anarchy, but anarchy would be the best if humans were able to overcome their selfishness. Anarchy would only work if most people were very altruistic.</p>

                    I used Disqus, but I removed it because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
                    and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
