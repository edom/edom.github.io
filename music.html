<h3 id="the-composition-should-have-between-5-and-9-instrument-sections"><span class="section_number">1.1</span><span class="section_title">The composition should have between 5 and 9 instrument sections</span></h3>
<p>A middle school string orchestra is usually divided into 5 sections: violin 1, violin 2, viola, cello, and bass. But perhaps it should be divided into 9 sections: violin solo, violin 1, violin 2, viola solo, viola, cello solo, cello, bass solo, and bass. This addresses the ability differences. Make the piece fun for the incompetent players and challenging for the competent players. It's like writing a quadruple concerto. It's like writing a piece for a great string quintet and a so-so orchestra. A festival string orchestra is basically a great string quintet accompanied by a so-so orchestra.</p>
<h3 id="the-composition-should-be-at-least-4-minute-long"><span class="section_number">1.2</span><span class="section_title">The composition should be at least 4 minute long</span></h3>
<p>I composed a song that lasts below 2 minutes, and I definitely felt that it was too short.</p>
<p>Write the solo parts first. Then write the bass part. The write the middle voices. Unless you are writing a counterpoint.</p>
<p>Stick to fun singable cool pop-ish simple tonal music, but not over-simplified. These kids get bored super quickly, and they can't even play chords with correct intonation.</p>
<h3 id="the-composition-form-should-be-ritornello-or-sonata"><span class="section_number">1.3</span><span class="section_title">The composition form should be ritornello or sonata</span></h3>
<p>Interesting, memorable, learnable, some repetition but not boring.</p>
<p>Ritornello is A B1 A B2 A B3 … A Bn … That is, the music keeps &quot;returning&quot; to A.</p>
<p>We can put solos/cadenzas in B sections.</p>
<h3 id="the-kids-should-be-taught-how-to-read-the-conductor"><span class="section_number">1.4</span><span class="section_title">The kids should be taught how to read the conductor</span></h3>
<p>The conductor must learn how to conduct, but the kids must also learn how to read the conductor.</p>
<p>The kid has to be taught about preparatory upbeats.</p>
<h3 id="tempo-fingerboard-hand-max-300-npm-bowing-hand-max-480-npm"><span class="section_number">1.5</span><span class="section_title">Tempo: Fingerboard hand max 300 npm, bowing hand max 480 npm</span></h3>
<p>Cellos are too big for the kids' hands. Don't write fast runs for middle school cellos.</p>
<p>The fingerboard hand should not have to play faster than 300 notes per minute. Thus, maximum tempo for the fingerboard hand is 360 bpm if shortest note is 1/4th note, 180 bpm if shortest note is 1/8th note, 90 bpm if shortest note is 1/16th note.</p>
<p>The bowing hand should not have to move faster than 480 notes per minute. Thus, maximum tempo for the bowing hand is 480 bpm if shortest note is 1/4th note, 240 bpm if shortest note is 1/8th note, 120 bpm if shortest note is 1/16th note.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learn-from-my-mistakes"><span class="section_number">1.6</span><span class="section_title">What I learn from my mistakes</span></h3>
<p>Don't require violin 2 to be the loudest part. Teachers seem to have instilled into the kids that they should never play louder than violin 1.</p>
<p>Do not assume that the conductor can conduct big tempo changes. Do not assume that the conductor can conduct stringendo.</p>

<p>A class is only as good as the worst kid in the class. Fire the shitty kids that cause the unfixable ability difference in your class. Don't let the shitty kids hold back your class from achieving greatness.</p>
<p>I classify a kid into four classes: great, good, bad, and shitty.</p>
<p>Great kids. Give them solos. Let them shine. Give them challenges.</p>
<p>Good kids. They are internally motivated. Good kids can become great kids with correct practice.</p>
<p>Bad kids. Incompetent but not malicious. Bad kids can become good kids through practice, discipline, dedication, effort, time, and sacrifices. Bad kids have good intentions, but they aren't fit yet for festivals.</p>
<p>Shitty kids will never improve. Lazy, indifferent, unwilling. Fire them immediately. If that is impossible, limit the damage done by these shitty kids. Obviously, these shitty kids should never play at festivals. These shitty kids should not be in your class in the first place. Talk to their parents to move those shitty kids to someone else's class that is not a music class. These kids are not born to play music. They may shine and be great kids somewhere else. Don't let them rot in your class. Don't waste your time and their time.</p>
<h3 id="the-kids-should-be-taught-how-to-synchronize-by-skipping-notes"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">The kids should be taught how to synchronize by skipping notes</span></h3>
<p>If you make a mistake or fall behind, then you should immediately synchronize, skip notes.</p>

<p>They should have an internal rhythm and internal counter. They should internally subdivide the beats.</p>
<p>They rush when playing difficult passages. This can only be solved by building internal metronome and doing slow practice.</p>
<h3 id="cellos-are-tricky"><span class="section_number">2.4</span><span class="section_title">Cellos are tricky</span></h3>
<p>This is about the average kid cellist.</p>
<p>These kid cellists have bad intonation and use vibrato too much. Vibrato will not fix intonation problem. If you place your finger at the wrong point, you need to <em>relocate</em> your hand; <em>wiggling</em> your hand will not fix the intonation.</p>
<p>A cello section with 9 great kids and 1 shitty kid is a shitty cello section. It will sound muddy.</p>
<p>Bass is even trickier.</p>

<p>Hilary Hahn, Mendelssohn's violin concerto</p>
<p>Itzhak Perlman</p>
<p>and other great violinists</p>
<p>Tell the kids to expressively move their body. The kids should not rigidly stay in a position for too long. Otherwise they will get muscle pains.</p>
<p>These motions are <em>not</em> for showing off, but for preventing muscle stiffness and pain.</p>
<h3 id="the-kids-must-be-able-to-change-tempo-and-dynamics-independently"><span class="section_number">2.8</span><span class="section_title">The kids must be able to change tempo and dynamics independently</span></h3>
<p>Don't get quieter when getting slower, unless the music demands it.</p>
<p>Don't get louder when getting faster, unless the music demands it.</p>
<p>To be able to improve, the kids must realize two things. First, they are shitty. Second, they <em>can</em> get out of that shittiness, but it is entirely up to them. If they get better, it is because they work.</p>
<p>Learning speed = teacher quality * student quality * student effort</p>
<p>If student effort is zero, everything else does not matter. Zero times anything is zero.</p>

<h3 id="the-kids-must-unconsciously-do-inverse-kinematics"><span class="section_number">2.10</span><span class="section_title">The kids must unconsciously do inverse kinematics</span></h3>
<p>Training the kids is asking the kids to internalize inverse kinematics<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I don't care how you play. I want good sound.</p>
<p>These principles may help us achieve a good sound.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bow must move straightly, must always form a right angle to the string. The point of contact must not wander.</li>
<li>You should not hurt yourself. Playing for 2 hours should not cause pain or stiffness. If you hurt yourself, you are using the wrong muscles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Human anatomy + straight-line bowing = the entire body has to move, primarily the arms, shoulders, and hip.</p>

<p>The students must be able to sing with correct intonation and clap with correct rhythm, regardless of whatever instrument they play.</p>
<p>The students must first hear it in their heads, and only then try to sing or play it.</p>
<p>The students must never think that fingerboard labels will save them.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-karawitan-and-gamelan"><span class="section_number">5.1.1</span><span class="section_title">What is karawitan and gamelan?</span></h4>
<p>Gamelan is a set of instruments. Karawitan is the activity of playing gamelan.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-javanese-balinese-and-sundanese-karawitan"><span class="section_number">5.1.2</span><span class="section_title">What is the difference between Javanese, Balinese, and Sundanese karawitan?</span></h4>
<p>Balinese karawitan sounds more dynamic, more loud, more fast, more bright, more active, more festive, and more dazzling than Javanese karawitan. Balinese karawitan has extreme dynamic changes. Javanese karawitan has extreme tempo changes, but never exceeds Balinese karawitan tempo. Balinese gamelan has slightly detuned pairs. Those who don't like karawitan may find Javanese karawitan boring and Balinese karawitan nauseating.</p>
<h4 id="i-have-little-karawitan-experience"><span class="section_number">5.1.3</span><span class="section_title">I have little karawitan experience</span></h4>
<p>I participated a little in Javanese karawitan. I saw live Balinese karawitan once in Bali. I don't know anything about Sundanese karawitan. Thus I write the piece with mostly Javanese and some Balinese karawitan in mind.</p>
<p>Gamelan has several tunings, but none is 12-tone. I approximate the tuning with Western pentatonic 1-3-4-5-7, although only in the melody.</p>
<h3 id="emulating-a-metallophone-with-a-string"><span class="section_number">5.2</span><span class="section_title">Emulating a metallophone with a string</span></h3>
<p>Accent each note. No legato, but no staccato. No vibrato. Spiccato is OK.</p>
<p>Longer notes have more sustain than higher notes. However, all notes decay.</p>
<p>The goal is to sound similar to this video<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="emulating-a-sindhén-female-singer"><span class="section_number">5.3</span><span class="section_title">Emulating a sindhén (female singer)</span></h3>
<p>Vibrato is OK.</p>
<p>A Javanese sindhén does these <em>less</em> than a Western opera singer does: vowel-rounding and larynx-dropping. The Javanese karawitan vowels are sharper than the Western opera vowels.</p>
<h3 id="tempo"><span class="section_number">5.4</span><span class="section_title">Tempo</span></h3>
<p>The fast tempo must be about twice of the slow tempo. The acceptable fast tempo is 108 to 120 bpm; 96 bpm is definitely too slow; 120 bpm is almost too fast; 132 bpm is definitely too fast. The acceptable slow tempo is 48 to 60 bpm; 60 bpm is a bit too fast. These tempo changes are extreme in Western music, but normal in Javanese karawitan.</p>
<p>Update &lt;2019-01-22&gt;: Change tempo from 120/60 to 108/54 bpm. Kick dynamics up a notch.</p>
