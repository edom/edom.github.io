<p>Welcome, fellow truth-seekers.</p>
<p>We have a problem: Google's search result for psychic-related queries is full of disinformation that hampers our research. I hope this article can change that. I also hope to change the majority opinion and hasten the scientific research on psychic abilities.</p>

<h3 id="psychics"><span class="section_number">1.1</span><span class="section_title">Psychics</span></h3>
<p>A <em>psychic</em> is a person with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_psychic_abilities&amp;oldid=928270792">psychic abilities</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>psychic claimant</em> is a person who <em>claims</em> to have psychic abilities. The truth of the claim is unknown, so we give the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>A <em>pseudopsychic</em> (a fake psychic) is a psychic claimant whose claims are known to be totally or mostly false.</p>
<p>A <em>cold reader</em> is one who does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading">cold reading</a>, which is fine until a cold reader claims to be a psychic whereas he/she is in fact a pseudopsychic. The problem is not cold reading. The problem is that many people claim to be what they are not.</p>
<p>How do we know someone is psychic?</p>
<p>Psychics give mostly true and <em>highly improbable</em> statements that we think they cannot know, whereas cold readers guess highly probable statements that everyone can know from collecting statistics. Psychics may not be 100% accurate, but they should be more accurate than guessers. Cold reading is totally explained by probability and psychology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect">Barnum/Forer effect</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_validation">subjective validation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.</p>
<h3 id="skeptics"><span class="section_number">1.2</span><span class="section_title">Skeptics</span></h3>
<p>A <em>skeptic</em> is a doubter (in a good sense), someone who is looking for the truth, someone who does not know, but would like to know. Skeptics change their beliefs according to evidence, after exhausting simpler explanations, including mistakes.</p>
<p>A <em>debunker</em> is someone who exposes false claims. The problem is: they only look for false claims and not true claims.</p>
<p>A <em>scientist</em> is a skeptic who uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">the scientific method</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>pseudoskeptic</em> (a fake skeptic) is a person who claims to be a skeptic but is not. There are several kinds of pseudoskeptics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">Ass-covering</a> pseudoskeptics</em> cave in to peer pressure. They fear being ostracized by their peers. They fear for their careers. They are reluctantly complicit in oppressing the truth. They are powerless. They mostly stay silent, but they occasionally affirm their allegiance when they are suspected of heresy.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism">Scientism</a> zealots</em> claim to be scientists, but they are actually religious extremists whose religion is mainstream science. They have become the very thing they sought to destroy.</li>
<li><em>Science despots</em> have built their careers, found comfort in their position, and settled to refuse any changes, the truth be damned. They can be found in all fields, not only in psychic research. They don't care about the truth; they only care about their comfort.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is useless to try to change pseudoskeptics. Instead, ignore them, and shout louder: write more about the truth, and muster fellow truth-seekers.</p>
<p>Science is not the truth, but is the search for the truth.</p>
<p>The problem of science despots is summarized by <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Planck 1949</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new scientific truth does not generally triumph by persuading its opponents and getting them to admit their errors, but rather by its opponents gradually dying out and giving way to a new generation that is raised on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see again the pattern: The biggest problem is that many people from all camps (psychics and skeptics) claim to be what they are not.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fringe_science&amp;oldid=927262305">evidence</a> that science is despotic.</p>
<h2 id="rectified-google-search-results"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">Rectified Google search results</span></h2>
<p>Around 2019-11-28, I searched Google for these queries: <a href="https://www.google.com/?q=psychic">psychic</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/?q=psychic+evidence">psychic evidence</a>. The results are full of disinformation.</p>
<p>Here I clean up the results. Beware that you may get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">different</a> results.</p>

<h3 id="dictionaries-definitions-and-lists"><span class="section_number">2.1</span><span class="section_title">Dictionaries, definitions, and lists</span></h3>
<p>There are some dictionary definitions of &quot;psychic&quot;. Those in <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/psychic">Cambridge</a> and <a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/psychic">Longman</a> are correct and unbiased. Those in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychic">Merriam-Webster</a> and <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/psychic">Dictionary.com</a> are biased with words like &quot;apparent&quot; or &quot;alleged&quot;. Those in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psychic">Wiktionary</a> are cowardly imprecise (&quot;A person who possesses, or appears to possess […]&quot;).</p>
<p>There is Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychic_abilities">list of psychic abilities</a>, which is surprisingly neutral, although that page sometimes gets vandalized.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-that-may-be-relevant-to-my-research"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">Other things that may be relevant to my research</span></h3>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/17/science-journal-withdraws-paper-suggested-evidence-some-people-are-psychic">news article about a retraction</a> of an article that has insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>There is a quite damning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/29041r/serious_psychics_of_reddit_do_you_knowingly_scam/">inside story of the pseudopsychic industry</a>. (Remember to mentally replace &quot;psychic&quot; with &quot;pseudopsychic&quot;.)</p>
<p>Russell Targ's book is more relevant but Google ranks it lower.</p>
<h3 id="detrimental-wikipedia-articles"><span class="section_number">2.3</span><span class="section_title">Detrimental Wikipedia articles</span></h3>
<p>There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic">mistitled Wikipedia article</a> which is about psychic claimants, not psychics. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Psychic&amp;oldid=921672968#%22A_psychic_is_a_person_who_claims...%22">complaint</a> was raised in 2015, but four years later there was still no progress. Such idiosyncratic redefinition prevents people from thinking about psychics.</p>
<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth">reflects the majority opinion</a>, and while they are mostly true, they are not the truth. The job of Wikipedia admins is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police">enforce policy</a> according to majority opinion, not to find out the truth. As a result, some editors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Editor_Retention/Discovered_reasons_given_for_leaving_Wikipedia">quit</a>.</p>
<p><em>Thus, to change Wikipedia, change the majority opinion.</em></p>
<p>Majority does not mean right; it simply means having power to decide which discourses are taboo; but truth respects no feelings or taboos.</p>
<p>Wikipedia itself says that it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source">unreliable</a>, so why do we insist on trusting it so much? Perhaps because the website looks authoritative at a glance.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-of-no-use-to-my-research"><span class="section_number">2.4</span><span class="section_title">Other things of no use to my research</span></h3>
<p>There is someone's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/22/psychics-how-a-sceptic-found-solace-in-clairvoyance">venting</a>. Her beliefs blind her from seeing things as they are. However, at least she is open to new experiences.</p>
<h3 id="advertisement-laden-pages-of-no-use-to-my-research"><span class="section_number">2.5</span><span class="section_title">Advertisement-laden pages of no use to my research</span></h3>
<p>These websites earn money mostly or solely from ads. More traffic means more money; hence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism">sensationalism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a> titles.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/two-neuroscientists-walk-into-a-psychic-fair/">low-information field report with clickbait title</a>. It does not matter whether they are neuroscientists if they are not using any neuroscience in the article. The premise also doesn't make sense. If I were looking for psychics, I would first visit my friends who have psychic experiences, not a psychic-claimant fair. However, at least they are open to new experiences.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/so-are-psychics-real-or-what.html">shallow inconclusive misrepresentative article</a> is overly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a>-ed: three ads in the page, an image that does not add any information, many links to high-authority websites, but no original insight, just a rehash of the linked articles. Also, the crystal ball image is highly insulting to psychics.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/style/wellness-mediums.html">mistitled cynical news on medium claimants</a>, although there may be some truth to it.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ingridrojascontreras/life-lessons-from-my-mom-the-psychic">novel chapter writing exercise</a>, if you enjoy short stories.</p>

<p>There is an ad about &quot;Kasamba psychic chat&quot;, of which an ex-pseudopsychic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gzww4/iaman_internet_psychic_ama/c1rjl1y/">wrote</a> in 2011: &quot;Think of it like an ebay for bullshit.&quot; I visited the website, and I can see why.</p>
<p>There is an ad about a $649 &quot;Shiva god helmet&quot;, but perhaps we can meditate for $0 to get a similar profound experience. To me, it is at best an expensive crutch.</p>

<p>Our problems are mostly due to intellectual laziness and sloppy language.</p>
<p>An example of intellectual laziness is to blindly trust claims, be it from scientists or others.</p>

<p>IAC <a href="https://uk.iacworld.org/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-psychic-abilities/">claims</a> that someone can obtain some very basic psychic abilities in <em>three hours</em> with the <em>right technique</em>. But what is the right technique?</p>
<p>It assumes you're in England or Spain.</p>
<p>I have an unpleasant experience with the website. I tried to download their ebook, but it requires me to subscribe, so I did that, and then the website experiences an internal error, after asking for my personal data.</p>
<p>It seems mostly legitimate with some questionable things and yellow flags. It sells courses.</p>
<p>The only free thing there is a semi-marketing introduction video behind a login wall.</p>
<p>It gives me a bad first impression.</p>

<p>I feel that <a href="https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/">SSRF</a> is a bit off. Despite its name, I don't see any science in its website; no theories, no explanations, no experiments, only instructions and claims. Some people even <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Spiritual-Science-Research-Foundation-SSRF-brainwashing-people-with-their-so-called-spiritual-research">think</a> that SSRF is brainwashing.</p>

<p>Farsight Institute claims to have remote-viewed <a href="https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Moses_Beyond_Exodus_Farsight_Project_main_page.html">Moses</a> and <a href="http://farsightpresentations.com/RV_Projects/CrucifixionRuse.html">Jesus</a>. Those are some big claims.</p>

<p>ESP (Extra-Sensory Perception) is an oxymoron: If you can perceive it, you have a sensor for it; you just don't know what the sensor is. Perhaps ESP should be renamed to EOP (&quot;<em>Extra-Ordinary</em> Perception&quot;). Alas, the term has stuck, but words mean whatever we choose them to mean anyway, so let's stick with ESP.</p>
<p>The word &quot;supernatural&quot; is absurd: If it exists, then it is natural, because Nature is defined to be everything that exists. We should replace &quot;supernatural&quot; with &quot;extraordinary&quot;, &quot;unusual&quot;, &quot;unexplained&quot;, or &quot;anomalous&quot;.</p>

                    I used Disqus, but I removed it because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
                    and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
