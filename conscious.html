<h2 id="consciousness-is-the-ability-to-ken"><span class="section_number">1</span><span class="section_title">Consciousness is the ability to ken</span></h2>
<p><em>Consciousness</em> is the ability to ken, that is, to experience, but not necessarily to wit. Compare German <em>kennen</em> and <em>wissen</em>.</p>
<p>In the rest of this document, when I use &quot;know&quot;, I usually mean &quot;ken&quot; only and not to mean &quot;wit&quot;.</p>
<p>On the etymology of the word &quot;conscious&quot;, Wiktionary<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> says that it comes from Latin &quot;con-&quot; (together) and &quot;scire&quot; (to know).</p>
<p>Something is <em>conscious</em> iff it <em>can know</em>.</p>
<p>But that is trivial: If it knows, then it can know. I think we take it for granted as an axiom in alethic modal logic: If X is true, then X is possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are interested is whether something <em>can</em> know, not whether something knows.</p>
<p>While I'm sleeping, I'm <em>unconscious</em> (I have <em>low consciousness</em>), because I can only know very little while I'm sleeping.</p>
<p>I have <em>more consciousness</em> when I'm awake than when I'm asleep, because I <em>can know more</em> when I'm awake than when I'm asleep. But is that true? What if I can know in my sleep, but I just don't remember it?</p>
<p>Why are we so sure that a rock doesn't know anything?</p>
<h2 id="on-separating-the-double-meaning-of-consciousness"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">On separating the double meaning of &quot;consciousness&quot;</span></h2>
<p>Confusingly, we use the word &quot;consciousness&quot; for the subjective experience itself, besides for the <em>ability</em> to have such subjective experience.</p>
<p>We need two words for those two senses. What are good words?</p>
<p>We use the word &quot;quale&quot; (&quot;qualia&quot;) for subjective experience.</p>
<p>We use &quot;consciousness&quot; for the ability to have qualia.</p>
<p>&quot;X can Y&quot; is true iff there is something X can do to make &quot;X does Y&quot; true.</p>
<p>&quot;X can Y by Z&quot; is true iff X's doing Z makes &quot;X does Y&quot; true.</p>
<p>&quot;X can Y&quot; is true iff there exists Z such that &quot;X can Y by Z&quot; is true.</p>
<p>Example: Power is the ability to unleash harm, but is not harm itself. Indeed, when you unleash harm, your power is temporarily reduced, because you have to recharge your power for unleashing the next harm.</p>
<p>That makes me think.</p>
<p>A conscious being can unleash quale, in the same way a powerful being can unleash harm.</p>
<p>A conscious being can experience, in the same way a powerful being can harm.</p>
<p>How do we increase power? By weapons (harm multipliers), increasing our physical strength, and so on.</p>
<p>How do we increase consciousness? What are the consciousness multipliers? Meditation?</p>
<h2 id="consciousness-and-epistemology"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">Consciousness and epistemology</span></h2>
<p>In Kantian parlance, perhaps consciousness is the ability to have synthetic a-posteriori knowledge.</p>
<p>Defining consciousness as &quot;the ability to know&quot; raises two questions: What does it mean to <em>know</em> something? What does it mean to be <em>able</em> to do something? Those questions are the questions that epistemology aims to answer. Thus defining consciousness requires epistemology.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-measure-consciousness-ability-to-know"><span class="section_number">4</span><span class="section_title">How do we measure consciousness (ability to know)?</span></h2>
<p>How do we measure whether X has more consciousness than Y?</p>
<p><em>Degree of consciousness is a continuum.</em></p>
<p>I was conscious when I wrote this. There was a time after I was born but before I became conscious. There isn't any point in time when I suddenly become conscious.</p>

<li>If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment. The self concept will never arise.</li>
<li>If a brain can immediately control a thing, then that thing is part of the brain's self concept. If the brain can't, it's not.</li>
<li>If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output, it will associate the output with its self concept.</li>

<p>We don't know what &quot;knowledge&quot; is. But, for this section, assume that we know.</p>
<p>We think we can share or transfer some knowledge.</p>
<p>We can <em>transfer</em> some knowledge by <em>simulation</em>. Simulator-trained pilots <em>know</em> how to fly planes: If they can fly the planes in the simulator, they can fly the planes in reality.</p>
<p>We can <em>transfer</em> some knowledge by <em>teaching</em>. School teachers <em>transfer</em> knowledge to their students.</p>
<p>Language enables some knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>We don't know how to transfer other knowledge. The taste of salt. The hue of green.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday technology will enable transferring all knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-software-copy-and-move"><span class="section_number">8.2</span><span class="section_title">Knowledge, software, copy, and move</span></h3>
<p>We can <em>copy</em> knowledge, but not <em>move</em> knowledge. This is similar to software: it can be copied but not moved. By move I mean: when you move your car from place A to place B, the car is now at B, and is no longer at A. But we don't <em>move</em> software from hardware A to hardware B; we <em>copy</em> it from A to B, and then <em>delete</em> the copy at A. The same with knowledge: We don't move it from person A to person B; we <em>copy</em> it; we spread it; and we don't know how to <em>delete</em> knowledge from a person.</p>
<p>Books are not knowledge. Books contain <em>text</em>, not knowledge. Destroying a book is like destroying a computer disk that contains a program.</p>
<h3 id="old-english-ken-wit-and-knowledge"><span class="section_number">8.3</span><span class="section_title">Old English, ken, wit, and knowledge</span></h3>
<p>German has &quot;kennen&quot; and &quot;wissen&quot;. English has &quot;ken&quot; and &quot;wit&quot;.</p>
<p>To ken something is to have experienced something.</p>
<p>To wit something is to remember something.</p>

</ul>
<p>&quot;I know that water is H2O&quot; means &quot;I <em>trust</em> the book that says water is H2O&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I know how beef tastes&quot; means &quot;I <em>have experienced</em> the taste of beef, and I believe that all beef tastes that way&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what 2 times 1234567 is&quot; means &quot;I know how to compute the result but I <em>don't bother</em> to&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whether the Riemann hypothesis is true&quot; means I don't know.</p>
<p>&quot;I know the Pythagorean theorem&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know a proof of the Pythagorean theorem&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know a person who can do that&quot;</p>
<p>In all cases, knowledge implies <em>memory</em>.</p>

<p>Knowledge without justification is &quot;dumb luck&quot;: <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/384314/is-there-a-word-for-an-unjustified-true-belief">https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/384314/is-there-a-word-for-an-unjustified-true-belief</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge is a <em>subset</em> of belief?</p>
<p>Every knowledge is a belief. There are beliefs that are not knowledge.</p>
<p>My knowledge of the taste of salt is a belief.</p>
<p>Language is not necessary for belief. For example, I can falsely believe that I have a shirt with this color that I can see in my mind but I can't describe to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrong: <em>Knowledge</em> is <em>belief</em> that agrees with <em>reality</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We know S&quot; means &quot;we believe S, and S is true&quot;.</p>
<p>When we say &quot;S is true&quot;, we mean that S is true in objective reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Belief is not binary</p>
<p>&quot;If an acquaintance suddenly contacts you after a long time of silence, he is trying to sell you insurance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the cloud looks gray, it's going to rain.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Distinguishing the absence of belief and the belief of absence</p>
<p>There is a difference between &quot;S does not believe P&quot; and &quot;S believes that P is false&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Beliefs that go against reality</p>
<p>False negative: S is true but I believe that S is false.</p>
<p>False positive: S is false but I believe that S is true.</p></li>

                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
