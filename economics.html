<p>We can think of money as seed and human as soil. Some humans are fertile soils for money to grow. A poor person who wins a lottery soon loses all of it. A rich person who wins a lottery keeps getting richer. A fool and his money are soon parted. However, this way of thinking puts money first and human second.</p>
<p>We can think of how fast money flows through a person.</p>
<h3 id="money-as-peoples-way-of-voting-for-what-they-want"><span class="section_number">1.2</span><span class="section_title">Money as people's way of voting for what they want</span></h3>
<p>Money is a way for people to vote for what they want. People vote with their money.</p>
<p>Money is the consumer's vote for what producers should do.</p>
<p>Money is the people's vote for what companies should do.</p>

<h3 id="money-as-blood"><span class="section_number">1.4</span><span class="section_title">Money as blood</span></h3>
<p>Economic actors are the organs, and money is the blood.</p>
<h3 id="money-is-valuable-due-to-higher-order-belief"><span class="section_number">1.5</span><span class="section_title">Money is valuable due to higher-order belief</span></h3>
<p>People believe that money is valuable because they believe that others also believe that money is valuable.</p>
<p>The value of money depends on whether there are people nearby willing to accept it.</p>
<p>Money has no inherent value. We attach value to money.</p>
<p>It's the same: Words do not have inherent meaning, We attach meaning to words.</p>
<p>It's all convention that enables us to exchange. Language enables the exchange of ideas. Money enables the exchange of goods.</p>

<p>The direct cause of profit is the ability to sell something at a price higher than its production cost.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Why is a working car more valuable than a broken car?</p>
<p>From neuroscientific point of view, people buy because of dopamine?</p>

<li>land (all other things that exist in nature),</li>
<li>labor (human),</li>

<p>If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.</p>
<p>Labor without capital is inefficient.</p>
<p>Capital without labor is <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>However, without land, nothing would exist at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,</p>
<p>But it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.</p>
<p>Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:</p>

<p>We say that a person <em>gambles</em> iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:</p>

<li>There exists a bet.</li>
<li>There does not exist control.</li>

<p>The gambler doesn't have <em>any</em> control over the outcome of a gamble. How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation? Too hard to predict?</p>
<p>The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't. The casino can control the outcome.</p>

<li>&quot;Insurance is a very specific type of gambling.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead), the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example), and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit).&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p>Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?</p>
<p>Is professional poker gambling? If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.</p>
<p>If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.</p>
<p>Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people? Slot machines? Guessing computer-generated numbers? What is a possible physical explanation?</p>
<p>How do we argue that binary option is gambling?</p>
<p>I saw binary options marketed with fake Facebook comments. I know those Facebook comments are fake because all of them have perfect grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. Real Facebook comment threads are full of shit.</p>

<p>What are we trying to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to make the system works for us instead of making us work for the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Altman puts it concisely: &quot;You get rich by owning things.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Why do we get rich by owning things?</p>
<p>Because we can ask the police to violate whomever violates our ownership (unless the perpetrator is the government itself).</p>
<p>Respecting private property enables the accumulation of wealth and the ensuing economic inequality.</p>
<p>Inequality is not poverty.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Poverty, not inequality, is the problem.</p>
<p>We have several choices to reduce inequality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embrace capitalism: Make everyone own properties and educate everyone to spend money wisely.</li>
<li>Oppose capitalism: Steal from the rich, give to the poor, although this incentivizes poverty. Abolish private ownership. But isn't this envy-based politics?</li>
</ul>
<p>But why should we reduce inequality? It is poverty that we should reduce, not inequality.</p>
<p>Of course some poverty is due to bad luck, and we should help people who fall into poverty due to bad luck. But too many entitlement programs are trapping people in poverty.</p>
<p>It is up to us whether we want to find ways to own properties.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-company"><span class="section_number">17.1</span><span class="section_title">What is a company?</span></h3>
<p>A company is a <em>legal fiction</em> for concentrating wealth (economic power) to its shareholders. Such economic power often translates to other forms of power such as political power.</p>
<p>A company is rife with <em>principal-agent problems</em> and <em>conflicts of interest</em>. There is one principal-agent problem between the shareholders and the directors. There is another principal-agent problem between the directors and the employees. There is one principal-agent problem for each layer of management.</p>
<p>It is a physically impossible to build or hurt a company. A company cannot do anything. People do things.</p>
<p>A company is an abstract object with concrete consequences. The legal fiction is unreal. The environmental effects are real.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-economy"><span class="section_number">17.2</span><span class="section_title">What is &quot;economy&quot;?</span></h3>
<p>What is &quot;economy&quot;? What is &quot;economy&quot; in &quot;economic meltdown&quot;?</p>
<p>Exchange? Trade?</p>
<p>Satisfy maximum wants using minimum resources. There are two solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce wants.</li>
<li>Use more resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economics is easy to explain but hard to predict. Economics is too interconnected.</p>
<p>Demand/consumption is easy; supply/production is hard.</p>
<p><em>Demand is easy.</em> We can want anything. Changing our minds is free.</p>
<p><em>Supply is hard.</em> We have to work to satisfy our demands.</p>
<p>Consumption is easy. Production is hard. Destruction is easy. Creation is hard. Second law of thermodynamics: The entropy of the Universe never decreases. In nature, entropy never decreases. Disorder arises naturally. The second law of thermodynamics explains why consumption is easier than production.</p>
<p>The nature of economics is that demand is free, but supply is costly.. Changing demand is cheap: you just change your mind. Changing supply is costly: all the infrastructure that has been built won't simply turn back into cash.</p>
<p>Demand first or supply first? Human nature is the root cause of economic demands. There will always be demand for food and shelter. There is always demand to make life easier and less boring.</p>
<p>However, in the case of iPhone, we have two views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve Jobs's presentation causes people to want iPhones. Supply creates demand.</li>
<li>People always want an easier way to live. Steve Jobs's iPhone just happens to make people's lives easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: We want an easier way to live. People don't want iPhones for iPhones's sake. People want iPhones because people believe iPhones make people's lives easier.</p>
<p>If demand surges, it will collapse later. Example: tulip mania.</p>
<h3 id="economic-recession"><span class="section_number">17.3</span><span class="section_title">Economic recession</span></h3>
<p>Economic recession is the reduction of money flow velocity.</p>
<p>How do we predict recession? How do we measure and monitor money flow velocity?</p>
<ul>
<li>people savings balance</li>
<li>mass layoffs</li>
<li>mass price hikes for vital goods (oil?)</li>
<li>company profit/loss statements</li>
<li>money accumulates at few economic actors</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology introduction, demand shift among substitute goods:</p>
<p>A demand shift is a demand collapse and a demand surge.</p>
<p>Cheaper robotic workers (or increasing minimum wages) causes demand for human workers to collapse and demand for robotic workers to surge.</p>
<p>Demand shifts among substitute goods.</p>
<h3 id="fluid-dynamics-explains-economic-recessions"><span class="section_number">17.4</span><span class="section_title">Fluid dynamics explains economic recessions</span></h3>
<p>Economic recession happens because money flow slows down.</p>
<p>Money is a fluid. A fluid flows. Fluid flow velocity depends on pressure at the source and resistances in the path.</p>
<p>If we want to maintain flow velocity despite increasing resistance, we have to increase pressure at the source of the fluid flow. But do we want this?</p>
<p>Money flow slows down because people spend less.</p>
<p>People spend less because they have less discretionary income.</p>
<p>People have less discretionary income because they are fired, or governments raise taxes, or important things get more expensive, etc.</p>
<p>Assumption: A person's behavior changes slowly, if it changes at all. A person who has never cared about the environment will not suddenly care about the environment.</p>
<p>A recession has two possible direct causes: <em>demand collapse</em> or <em>supply collapse</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of supply collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine collapse, oil rig explosion, etc.</li>
<li>Disasters: fire, earthquake, tsunami, flood, volcanic eruption, etc..</li>
<li>Lots of people going out of workforce at once (into pension, dying in war, etc.).</li>
<li>Lots of people suddenly becoming conscious (Google workers demonstrating for transparency, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of demand collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin ran out of fools (greater fool theory).</li>
<li>Renewable energy sources reduce oil demand.</li>
<li>Young people adopt a minimalist lifestyle after realizing that consumerism is unsustainable.</li>
<li>Government increases minimum wage big enough to make switching to robots looks cheap. Lots of companies introduce robot workers at the same time, making human workers redundant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply collapse is caused by physical destruction. Demand collapse is self-inflicted human condition.</p>
<p>Consumers supply demands to producers. Consumers demand supplies from producers. Take and give. To demand is to take, to consume, to destroy. To supply is to give, to produce, to create.</p>
<p>What does inverted yield curve has to do with recession? What does time preference have to do with economic recession? What is an economic recession?</p>
<p>CAGR = compound annualized growth rate.</p>
<p>What is the yield of a bond? A bond's yield is the CAGR of the bond price.</p>
<p>What is the yield curve? The yield curve is the curve in a plot with two axes: the horizontal axis is tenor (duration to maturity), and the vertical axis is yield.</p>
<p>An inverted yield curve indicates that buyers are pessimistic about the bond's future?</p>

<p>What Bitcoin &quot;investing&quot; is:</p>

<li>You buy a certificate of environmental destruction from someone, probably a &quot;miner&quot;.</li>
<li>You expect a greater fool to buy that certificate from you at a higher price. There are millions of other people who are looking for someone else more stupid than them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin is massive wealth transfer from late buyers to early buyers. All financial investing is massive &quot;realistic-return&quot; Ponzi scheme. Exactly fits the definition. Newcomers pay oldtimers. Late buyers pay early buyers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is not necessary at all. It is pure want. Inflation target disincentivizes currency hoarding.

<h3 id="economics-price-quality"><span class="section_number">17.11</span><span class="section_title">Economics, price, quality</span></h3>
<p>Price is not important in itself. It is the quality-price trade-off that is important. People don't buy shit even if it's cheap, even if you pay them to buy it.</p>
<p>For an increment of quality, people are willing to pay an increment of price. But there is a &quot;good enough&quot; point where people are satisfied and they just look at the lowest price.</p>
<p>Negative price means willingness to pay to get rid of something. Example: rotten vegetables has negative price to most people, but positive price to farmers.</p>
<h3 id="economics"><span class="section_number">17.12</span><span class="section_title">Economics?</span></h3>
<p>We should measure debt-to-income ratio instead of debt-to-GDP ratio?</p>
<p>Consumptive debt sacrifices future for the present.</p>
<p>Productive debt is good.</p>
<p>Example of productive debt:</p>
<p>Suppose that you want to buy a land to farm on it. These are the scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>You work for 20 years. Then you buy the land with cash. But the land price has risen.</li>
<li>You take a loan, buy the land now, and repay the loan over 10 years. In the second year, your land starts producing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a person takes too much consumptive debt, he goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>If a government takes too much consumptive debt nominated in its own currency, it can print money to repay the debt, but such printing devalues the currency.</p>
<p>If the US continues to take loans mindlessly, it will have to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default (refuse to repay).</li>
<li>Suffer severe inflation (rising prices), if the creditors spend the printed money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the USA think it can get away by refusing to repay its debts? It will trigger a huge power shift, maybe to China. Will China sacrifice itself to clean up America's mess? Will China buy up all US debts, and use the default as a reason to start a war?</p>

<p>Urban toilet harms humans and the Earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>We should poo squatting, not sitting.</li>
<li>Urine and feces should be composted, not flushed down the drain.</li>
<li>Compost bins should replace septic tanks.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are only two ways to get rich: <em>earn</em> wealth or <em>steal</em> wealth.</p>
<p>Earn wealth: convince people to give you money, by selling them things that improve their lives. Use the money to develop your wealth even more.</p>
<p>Or steal wealth: An investor steals a little wealth from each person who does not invest.</p>
<p>After you obtain enough wealth, develop it, but don't lose all of them.</p>
