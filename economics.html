        <ul>
          <li><em>Wealth</em> is the sum of satisfied wants.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>price, pay, ownership, exchange, transaction
        <ul>
          <li>To <em>own</em> something is to have exclusive access to that thing.</li>
          <li><em>Exchange</em> and <em>transaction</em> are synonyms.</li>
          <li>An <em>exchange</em> is an agreement
            <ul>
              <li>between two parties A and B where
                <ul>
                  <li>A gives X to B,</li>
                  <li>B gives Y to A.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If X is money and Y is not money, then:
            <ul>
              <li>X is the price.
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Price</em> is the amount agreed for exchange.</li>
                  <li><em>Price</em> is something sacrificed to get something else.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>A is the buyer.</li>
              <li>B is the seller.</li>
              <li>The buyer <em>pays</em> the price to the seller.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>negotiation, price-taker, price-maker
        <ul>
          <li>Negotiating parties often have asymmetrical bargaining power.</li>
          <li>The price-taker is the weaker one.</li>
          <li>The price-maker is the stronger one.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>money and currency
        <ul>
          <li>Money has <em>currency</em> and <em>amount</em> (<em>magnitude</em>).</li>
          <li>Money can be <em>exchanged</em> with many other things.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>debt, interest, and price
        <ul>
          <li>The price of debt is the <em>interest</em>
  (the amount of money that will be exchanged for obtaining the loan now).
            <ul>
              <li>An X market is a market where X is traded.
                <ul>
                  <li>A money market is a market where money is traded.

          <li>Has priorities? Utility function?

        <ul>

  <li>Higher-order belief
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest">WP:Keynesian beauty contest</a></li>
      <li>Examples of higher-order beliefs:
        <ul>
          <li>People believe that money is valuable because they believe
  that others also believe that money is valuable.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Land &gt; Labor &gt; Capital
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production">factors of production</a>
  in classical economics are:
        <ul>
          <li>land (all other things that exist in nature),</li>
          <li>labor (human),</li>
          <li>capital (tools).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Land creates labor.</li>
      <li>Labor creates capital.</li>
      <li>If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.</li>
      <li>If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.</li>
      <li>Labor without capital is inefficient.</li>
      <li>Capital without labor is <em>nothing</em>.</li>
      <li>However, without land, nothing would exist at all.</li>
      <li>Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,
        <ul>
          <li>but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:
        <blockquote>
          <p>When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted;
when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late,
that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can’t eat money.</p>

      <li>Tax enables government to redistribute money (and therefore some wealth).</li>
      <li>Tax enables government to discourage the consumption of certain goods.</li>
      <li>Taxation is legalized robbery.

  <li>Questions I haven’t been able to answer
    <ul>
      <li>If everybody needs to buy food, then why aren’t farmers the richest people on Earth?
        <ul>
          <li>What if the farmers don’t spend?
            <ul>
              <li>Will money collect at the farmers?</li>
              <li>Will they be the richest people on Earth?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money circulation
    <ul>
      <li>Circulating money amount should be proportional to amount of goods/services exchanged?</li>
      <li>The amount of money in circulation can be reduced by tax or destruction.</li>
      <li>Why do governments sell bonds?
        <ul>
          <li>To reduce the amount of money in circulation now?
            <ul>
              <li>At the cost of increasing a bigger amount of money circulating in the future?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Money moves faster in certain areas?</li>
      <li>How does the government increases the amount of money in circulation?
        <ul>
          <li>How I think it might be done:
            <ul>
              <li>Create new money.</li>
              <li>Spend that money by buying things from a few elites,
                <ul>
                  <li>with the hope that the elites will quickly spend that money to the lesser elites.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Thus that money will circulate to more people.
                        <ul>
                          <li>But isn’t this trickle-down economics?</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>But does it even do this? Isn’t it the banks?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What is the effect of people’s borrowing from banks?
        <ul>
          <li>Increase circulating money now (boom part of boom-bust cycle).</li>
          <li>Reduce <em>more</em> circulating money later (bust part of boom-bust cycle, when the loan is paid back with interest).
            <ul>
              <li>Principal plus interest (money retired) is greater than principal (money created),
  so the net effect of lending money now
  is a delayed reduction of a greater amount of money in circulation.
                <ul>
                  <li>Where does the money to pay the interest come from?
                    <ul>
                      <li>If left alone, eventually the money collects at the banks?
                        <ul>
                          <li>But banks have expenses too.
                            <ul>
                              <li>Banks need to pay taxes, pay their utility bills,
  pay their staffs.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>But shouldn’t the money collect at the farmers?</li>
                        </ul>
