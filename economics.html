<h4 id="human-wants"><span class="section_number">4.2.1</span><span class="section_title">Human wants</span></h4>
<p>What do humans want?</p>
<p>The <em>root want</em> of humans, hardwired into them by evolution, is to <em>survive and have fun</em>. From that root want come all other wants, such as to survive longer, in more environments, with less effort; to eat; to move; to belong to a community; to have a place to rest; to have companions and offsprings; to understand nature; and so on.</p>
<p>A problem with such theory of root want is the failure to explain <em>suicide</em>, the antithesis of survival. But this problem is solved, if it is the human <em>species</em> that wants to survive, and not the human <em>individual</em>. Thus, perhaps the species benefits from having some suicidal individuals. But what evolutionary advantage does a suicidal individual confer upon the species?<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Why do some people commit suicide? Don't they want to survive?</p>
<p>Another problem with such theory of root want is to explain wants that detriment survival, such as cigarette-smoking. But this problem is solved, if humans only need to survive until their children can live independently, assuming that humans begin having kids at 20. Thus, if something is harmful, but fun, and takes more than 40 years to kill a human, then there will be someone stupid enough to do it, such as cigarette-smoking, because, before 20th century healthcare, perhaps humans rarely lived past 40, which is perhaps why evolution did not care about the fertility of women after 40<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Such theory of root want also has to explain <em>crimes</em>. Crime in the 21st century endangers the criminal's survival, but before states and police were invented, crime such as stealing food and murdering others does indeed improve the criminal's survival.</p>
<p>Every human has a <em>preference</em> shaped by his genetics, history, and circumstances. But sometimes this preference seems nonsensical. For example, do thieves want the stolen thing more than they want freedom from jail? Do smokers and junk food eaters want the taste of cigarette and food more than they want health?</p>
<p>A satisfied man soon gets bored and begins wanting more. Why did we evolve boredom? What is the evolutionary advantage of boredom?</p>
<p>Boredom drives the desire of newer and better ways to do things.</p>
<p><em>Boredom drives technological innovation.</em></p>
<p>Boredom, curiosity, and fear improve survival.</p>
<p>Cautious curiosity improves survival.</p>
<p>Natural sciences and social sciences need not be divided, because all social sciences are about human nature, which can be partially explained by the theory of <em>evolution</em>, which is studied in <em>biology</em>. For an example of relationship between biology and economy, it would not be unreasonable to posit that hormones affect buying decisions. What complicates social sciences is that the chain of causes is not a simple line as in natural sciences, but is a complex graph of necessary causes that must happen together in order to cause the effect. However, the objects of study of social sciences are nevertheless parts of nature, and thus ultimately follow the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Negative externality is the problem: The polluters do not bear the cost themselves.</p>
<p>If we want to keep capitalism, but we do not want kill all of us, then we have to have an environmental-damage tax.</p>
<p>The solution is simple in principle: Carbon tax.</p>
<p>But the solution is not simple in practice: All countries have to agree on the same carbon tax. If a country does not have a carbon tax, then the polluters will move there.</p>

<p><em>Economy</em> is the stewardship of households.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Economics</em> studies how we should satisfy our wants.</p>
<p>We live in <em>economic systems</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These concepts are fundamental: utility, want, value, wealth, moneyfulness/pecuniosity.</p>
<p>A thing is <em>useful</em> iff it satisfies a <em>want</em>.</p>
<p>A thing's <em>value</em> is its ability to satisfy wants.</p>
<p>useful = valuable</p>
<p><em>Wealth</em> is the sum of satisfied wants.</p>
<p>A farmer is <em>wealthy</em>, because he satisfies most of his wants; but he is <em>impecunious</em> (moneyless). The opposite, a person too busy working for a consulting firm, is <em>pecunious</em> (moneyful) but <em>unwealthy</em>, because, despite having a lot of money, he is hardly satisfied; he has enough money to eat delicious foods every day, but he does not have the time.</p>
<p><em>Do not conflate price and value.</em></p>
<p><em>Price</em> is the amount of money paid for value.</p>
<p>To <em>own</em> something is to be able to defend the exclusive access to that thing. What is owned is defined by the owner's ability to defend his possessions. If the owner is incapable of violence, directly or indirectly, then he is incapable of ownership.</p>
<p>Price, pay, ownership, exchange, transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Exchange</em> and <em>transaction</em> are synonyms.</li>
<li>An <em>exchange</em> is an agreement between two parties A and B in which
<ul>
<li>A gives X to B,</li>
<li>B gives Y to A.</li>
<li>If X is money and Y is not money, then:
<ul>
<li>X is the price.
<ul>
<li><em>Price</em> is the amount agreed for exchange.</li>
<li><em>Price</em> is something sacrificed to get something else.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A is the buyer.</li>
<li>B is the seller.</li>
<li>The buyer <em>pays</em> the price to the seller.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="money-and-currency"><span class="section_number">6.2</span><span class="section_title">money and currency</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Money has <em>currency</em> and <em>amount</em> (<em>magnitude</em>).</li>
<li>Money can be <em>exchanged</em> with many other things.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debt-interest-and-price"><span class="section_number">6.3</span><span class="section_title">debt, interest, and price</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The price of debt is the <em>interest</em> (the amount of money that will be exchanged for obtaining the loan now).
<ul>
<li>An X market is a market where X is traded.
<ul>
<li>A money market is a market where money is traded.

<h3 id="land-labor-capital"><span class="section_number">6.4</span><span class="section_title">Land &gt; Labor &gt; Capital</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <em>factors of production</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> in classical economics are:
<ul>
<li>land (everything that exists in the Universe, except labor and capital),</li>
<li>labor (human),</li>
<li>capital (tools).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Land creates labor.</p>
<p>Labor creates capital.</p>
<p>If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.</p>
<p>If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.</p>
<p>Labor without capital is inefficient.</p>
<p>Capital without labor is <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>However, without land, nothing would exist at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,</p>
<p>But it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.</p>
<p>Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted; when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late, that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can't eat money.</p>

<p>Productivity is <em>output per input</em>.</p>
<p>Economically, <em>output</em> is something satisfying a want. For example, a machine produces goods, but it also produces heat, pollution, and waste, but only the goods is useful to humans, and thus the goods is the output.</p>
<p>Production is a process of transforming <em>less useful</em> things into <em>more useful</em> things. What is useful is determined by human nature, which is ultimately shaped by evolution.</p>
<p>Thus, productivity is the <em>efficiency</em> of production.</p>
<p>Thus, productivity is the rate of addition of value.</p>
<p>An examples of false productivity that feels good but only wastes time is checking off lots of unimportant things from a to-do list. Another example is sorting files and folders that we rarely use. Those are examples of being <em>unproductively busy</em>.</p>
<p>In manufacturing, a defective product does not satisfy wants, and thus defective products reduce productivity. However, an overzealous quality control for zero defect rate also reduces productivity.</p>

<p>Productivity increases <em>wealth</em>. Profit increases <em>pecuniosity</em> (<em>moneyfulness</em>).</p>
<p>Productivity is <em>real</em>. Profit is <em>nominal</em>.</p>
<p>Productivity is about <em>value</em>. Profit is about <em>price</em>.</p>
<p>Productivity does not always mean profitability. For example, a farmer may produce a lot of oranges, but when the demand for oranges is low, he may not be able to sell his excess production for profit.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-be-produced"><span class="section_number">7.4</span><span class="section_title">What should be produced?</span></h3>
<p>We should produce <em>goods</em>, which is what is <em>good</em>, which depends on the <em>moral system</em> we subscribe to.</p>
<p>A <em>utilitarian</em> produces what maximizes the <em>total satisfaction of the population</em>. However, he has no qualms killing 1,000 people to save 1,000,000 people.</p>
<p>A <em>hedonist</em> produces what brings him the most joy when he produces it. But what good is production for its own sake?</p>

<p>People consume to satisfy their wants.</p>
<p>Consumption is the dual of production.</p>
<p>Satisfaction is the dual of quality.</p>
<p>Consumption is the dual of production? But production is not exactly the opposite of consumption: <em>Consumption produces</em> satisfaction, and <em>production consumes</em> input. But for something to be consumed, it must first be produced.</p>
<p>We can think of a chain of boxes; each box consumes its inputs and produces its outputs; the outputs of a box are the inputs of another box, and so on. The end goal is to produce <em>satisfaction</em>.</p>

<h3 id="technology-as-productivity-multiplier"><span class="section_number">8.1</span><span class="section_title">Technology as productivity multiplier</span></h3>
<p>Economically, a technology, including software, no matter how sophisticated, can be thought of as just a <em>productivity multiplier</em>, that <em>helps</em> satisfy wants by improving the productivity in producing existing goods and services. The word &quot;help&quot; is emphasized, because technology is the means, not the end, which is the satisfaction of human wants. At the end of all sophisticated technologies is the satisfaction of human wants, one of which is to survive with less effort, which drives the development of many technologies, such as self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, planetary defense, and so on.</p>
<p>One does not want hardware only or software only. One wants a <em>system</em>, sometimes a machine, a combination of hardware and software, that satisfies some wants.</p>
<p>Software is limited by hardware. Hardware is limited by reality. But few people are going to buy hardware that cannot run existing software.</p>
<h3 id="productivity-and-unit-economics"><span class="section_number">8.2</span><span class="section_title">Productivity and unit economics</span></h3>
<p>Unit economics is the <em>nominalization</em> of productivity. Unit economics is obtained by converting the factors in productivity into monetary amounts, using prices obtainable by the agent in consideration.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-productivity"><span class="section_number">8.3</span><span class="section_title">Comparing productivity</span></h3>
<p>An over-simplified imaginary example of comparing the productivity of two productions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process 1: A human takes 0.1 kg of rice and 8 hours of labor, and gives 10 clothes per day.</li>
<li>Process 2: A machine takes 0.1 kg of fuel and 1 hour of labor, and gives 100 clothes per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both processes produce outputs of the same quality.</li>
<li>Labor hours have been adjusted for skill.</li>
</ul>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\text{relative productivity} &amp;= \frac{\text{productivity 2}}{\text{productivity 1}}
\\ &amp;= \frac{\text{output 2} / \text{input 2}}{\text{output 1} / \text{input 1}}
\\ &amp;= \frac{\text{100 clothes} / (\text{0.1 kg fuel} + \text{1 hour labor})}{\text{10 clothes} / (\text{0.1 kg rice} + \text{8 hours labor})}
\\ &amp;= \frac{10 \cdot (\text{0.1 kg rice} + \text{8 hours labor})}{\text{0.1 kg fuel} + \text{1 hour labor}}
\\ &amp;= \frac{\text{10 kg rice} + \text{800 hours labor}}{\text{1 kg fuel} + \text{10 hour labor}}
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>That fraction cannot be simplified further without more simplifying assumptions.</p>
<p>The relative productivity can be <em>nominalized</em> with price assumptions. For example, with the assumption that rice is $0.86/kg, labor is $3/hour, and fuel is $1/kg, similar to Indonesian prices in 2019, we can compare the productivity of process 1 and process 2:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\$8.6 + \$2,400}{\$1 + \$30} &amp;= \frac{\$2,408.6}{\$31}
\\ &amp;\approx 77.7
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>Thus, process 2 is <em>nominally</em> 77.7 times as productive as process 1, under the above assumptions.</p>
<p>The nominal relative productivity changes with price changes.</p>
<p>Only <em>scarce resources</em> need to be considered economically. What is scarce depends on the situation. For example, on a typical day on Earth in the 21st century, oxygen is abundant; but in a spaceship, oxygen is scarce.</p>
<p>The input is material and energy. The output is material and energy.</p>
<h3 id="economic-production-processes"><span class="section_number">8.4</span><span class="section_title">Economic production processes</span></h3>
<p>Processes can be composed. If process P transforms X to Y with productivity p, and process Q transforms Y to Z with productivity q, then process PQ transforms X to Z with productivity pq.</p>
<h3 id="valuation-of-technologies"><span class="section_number">8.5</span><span class="section_title">Valuation of technologies</span></h3>
<p>If the <em>new process</em> takes $1 to produce a cloth, and the <em>common process</em> takes $10 to produce a cloth, then the <em>advantage</em> of the new process over the common process is $9 per cloth.</p>
<p>The following pricing example will make us understand. If I am the only one who can produce clothes at $1 each, and the best everybody else can produce clothes at is $10 each, then I can extract a maximum profit of $9 per cloth, <em>until</em> someone else catches up with my technology, until he independently reinvents my technology or something better, until my technology becomes <em>common</em> or obsolete. If I can expect to sell 1,000 clothes before my technology becomes common, then I can expect a profit of $9,000 from this technology, and thus the price of my technology should be $9,000 minus the discount for time preference.</p>
<p>Therefore, the price of a new technology depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>its <em>advantage</em> against the common technology, and</li>
<li>its <em>difficulty</em>, that is, how hard it is to independently reinvent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Higher difficulty gives more time to profit from the technology, if trade secrets are protected, and if nobody else has been developing a similar technology.</p>
<p>The <em>no-arbitrage price</em> of a new technology is the <em>expected profit</em> brought about by using that new technology against the current technology. This price is relative to how far the agent can exploit the new technology.</p>
<p>What should be the price of a technology?</p>
<p>What should be the price of something?</p>
<p>What should be the price of a machine?</p>
<h3 id="technology-and-society-in-the-21st-century"><span class="section_number">8.6</span><span class="section_title">Technology and society in the 21st century</span></h3>
<p>The introduction of a technology obsoletes another technology, and thus reduces the demand for labor skilled in the old technology.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, technology development is speeding up, and new technologies are obsoleting skills faster than the obsolete-skilled humans can die naturally. This may create a huge unemployment and a huge population of poor old people.</p>

<h3 id="the-abstract-ideal-nature-of-software"><span class="section_number">9.1</span><span class="section_title">The abstract-ideal nature of software</span></h3>
<p>Software can be thought of as both goods and services.</p>
<p>In the goods view, an engineer <em>produces</em> software in the same way a chicken lays eggs.</p>
<p>In the services view, an engineer is a slave-driver that <em>translates</em> human wants into programs that force the machine to satisfy the wants.</p>
<p>But the goods view is somewhat strange: Software can be <em>copied</em> but not <em>moved</em>, unlike physical goods which can be <em>moved</em> but not <em>copied</em>.</p>
<p>Hardware is concrete and material. Software is abstract and ideal.</p>
<p>Software does not get consumed. Food gets consumed. When you eat food, the food is gone. When you use software, the software is still there. Software does not wear out.</p>
<h3 id="the-economics-of-abstract-ideal-things"><span class="section_number">9.2</span><span class="section_title">The economics of abstract-ideal things</span></h3>
<p>The non-materiality of software affects how we can sell it. In economic parlance, the marginal cost<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> of production of software is zero.</p>
<p>How do we profit from software without going against the abstract-ideal nature of software? The key is to sell an <em>embodiment</em> of the software, not the software itself. One way is to embody the software in hardware, and sell that hardware, such as calculators and Tamagotchis. Another way is the <em>software-as-a-service</em> (SaaS)<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> model, in which the software is usually presented as a website, typically embodied in hardware in a cloud, and what is sold is the <em>license</em> to use the software. A SaaS is like an amusement park: one pays for access to get in. The difference is that your experience of the amusement park belongs to you, but your data is usually locked into the SaaS vendor.</p>
<p>To make money from software without necessarily selling the software or an embodiment of it, also without going against the abstract-ideal nature of software, one can resort to <em>subscription</em> or <em>advertising</em>. But advertising destroys the Internet.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>An example of something that goes against the abstract-ideal nature of software is DRM (Digital Rights Management). It is fundamentally impossible; it is absurd; it is self-defeating; it goes against nature. Bruce Schneier sums it up in an eloquent analogy: &quot;Digital files cannot be made uncopyable, any more than water can be made not wet.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Anything that goes against nature is bound to encounter much hardship, if not immediate failure.</p>
<p>Another abstract-ideal thing is ideas. How do we sell ideas? How do we sell mathematics? How do we sell knowledge?</p>

<h3 id="is-it-practical-to-measure-productivity"><span class="section_number">10.1</span><span class="section_title">Is it practical to measure productivity?</span></h3>
<p>What does it mean to measure productivity?</p>
<p>It is impractical to trace all the causal chains.</p>
<p>It is easy to compare factory worker productivity between such workers because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The causal chain is very simple and short.</li>
<li>The interaction between factory workers do not affect each worker's productivity.</li>
<li>The environmental factors (machines, lighting, etc.) are constant and identical for all workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>A knowledge worker's productivity is affected by peer interaction.</p>
<p>In order to measure a programmer's productivity, he must first be isolated from everyone else. But this isolation affects his productivity?</p>
<p>If both A and B are necessary causes of C, then A or B alone is not sufficient to cause C. Each of A and B is a causal factor (necessary but not sufficient). The cause of C cannot be reduced to either A or B. Both of them are necessary to cause C. For example, in the fire triangle, all of fuel, oxygen, and heat are necessary to cause fire. The cause of fire cannot be reduced to any strict sub-combination of those three factors.</p>
<p>Measuring producitivity requires understanding causality.</p>
<p>It is not as simple as blaming the proximate (the nearest) cause. For example, suppose a smoker in a gas station causes an explosion. The blame is <em>largely</em>, but not <em>entirely</em> on the smoker, because the smoker alone is not enough to cause the explosion: the explosion requires gasoline vapor, which is caused by the existence of the gas station, which is caused by the demand for gas, which is caused by other car owners, and so on. In the end, all of humanity shares a little blame, although negligible.</p>

<p>Output should be a function of <em>quantity</em> and <em>quality</em>, but perhaps not a simple multiplication. If quality is too low, quantity does not matter, because no buyer wants it. If quality is too high, it does not matter, because no buyer can perceive the quality difference.</p>
<p>What is <em>quality</em>?</p>
<p>The ability to produce, or the ability to <em>satisfy consumers</em>? Producers don't produce for the sake of production. Producers keeps producing because there is unsatisfied demand.</p>
<p>Aren't we putting too much emphasis on consumption?</p>
<p>Quality is an arbitrary number? Subjective?</p>
<p>100 oranges at quality 20 vs 50 oranges at quality 40?</p>
<p>100 room-cleaning at quality 50 vs 50 room-cleaning at quality 100?</p>
<p>The output of a machine is defined by the machine's designer.</p>
<p>The output of a system is defined by the system's designer.</p>
<p>People always desire speed, easiness, simplicity, laziness, less effort, more joy, more fun, more chance of survival</p>

<p>We say that a person <em>gambles</em> iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:</p>
<ul>
<li>There exists a bet.</li>
<li>There does not exist control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other definitions of gambling:</p>

<p>How do we know something is not gambling? If it's possible to be skillful, then it's not gambling.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing</li>
<li>Trading</li>
<li>Betting</li>
<li>Random/uncontrollable</li>
<li>Individual outcome is unpredictable</li>
</ul>
<p>Can two unskilled people playing chess control the outcome?</p>
<p>Wager and bet are synonyms.</p>
<p>The gambler doesn't have <em>any</em> control over the outcome of a gamble. How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation? Too hard to predict?</p>
<p>The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't. The casino can control the outcome.</p>
<p>Although the individual outcomes are unpredictable, the trend is predictable.</p>
<p>Insurance is reverse gambling, which is also gambling. It is absurd to buy something that you avoid using.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Insurance is a very specific type of gambling.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead), the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example), and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit).&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?</p>
<p>Is professional poker gambling? If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.</p>
<p>If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.</p>
<p>Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people? Slot machines? Guessing computer-generated numbers? What is a possible physical explanation?</p>
<p>How do we argue that binary option is gambling?</p>
<p>I saw binary options marketed with fake Facebook comments. I know those Facebook comments are fake because all of them have perfect grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. Real Facebook comment threads are full of shit.</p>

<p>What are we trying to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to make the system works for us instead of making us work for the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Altman puts it concisely: &quot;You get rich by owning things.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Why do we get rich by owning things?</p>
<p>Because we can ask the police to violate whomever violates our ownership (unless the perpetrator is the government itself).</p>
<p>Respecting private property enables the accumulation of wealth and the ensuing economic inequality.</p>
<p>Inequality is not poverty.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Poverty, not inequality, is the problem.</p>
<p>We have several choices to reduce inequality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embrace capitalism: Make everyone own properties and educate everyone to spend money wisely.</li>
<li>Oppose capitalism: Steal from the rich, give to the poor, although this incentivizes poverty. Abolish private ownership. But isn't this envy-based politics?</li>
</ul>
<p>But why should we reduce inequality? It is poverty that we should reduce, not inequality.</p>
<p>Of course some poverty is due to bad luck, and we should help people who fall into poverty due to bad luck. But too many entitlement programs are trapping people in poverty.</p>
<p>It is up to us whether we want to find ways to own properties.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-company"><span class="section_number">11.4.1</span><span class="section_title">What is a company?</span></h4>
<p>A company is a <em>legal fiction</em> for concentrating wealth (economic power) to its shareholders. Such economic power often translates to other forms of power such as political power.</p>
<p>A company is rife with <em>principal-agent problems</em> and <em>conflicts of interest</em>. There is one principal-agent problem between the shareholders and the directors. There is another principal-agent problem between the directors and the employees. There is one principal-agent problem for each layer of management.</p>
<p>It is a physically impossible to build or hurt a company. A company cannot do anything. People do things.</p>
<p>A company is an abstract object with concrete consequences. The legal fiction is unreal. The environmental effects are real.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-economy"><span class="section_number">11.4.2</span><span class="section_title">What is &quot;economy&quot;?</span></h4>
<p>What is &quot;economy&quot;? What is &quot;economy&quot; in &quot;economic meltdown&quot;?</p>
<p>Exchange? Trade?</p>
<p>Satisfy maximum wants using minimum resources. There are two solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce wants.</li>
<li>Use more resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Economics is easy to explain but hard to predict. Economics is too interconnected.</p>
<p>Demand/consumption is easy; supply/production is hard.</p>
<p><em>Demand is easy.</em> We can want anything. Changing our minds is free.</p>
<p><em>Supply is hard.</em> We have to work to satisfy our demands.</p>
<p>Consumption is easy. Production is hard. Destruction is easy. Creation is hard. Second law of thermodynamics: The entropy of the Universe never decreases. In nature, entropy never decreases. Disorder arises naturally. The second law of thermodynamics explains why consumption is easier than production.</p>
<p>The nature of economics is that demand is free, but supply is costly.. Changing demand is cheap: you just change your mind. Changing supply is costly: all the infrastructure that has been built won't simply turn back into cash.</p>
<p>Demand first or supply first? Human nature is the root cause of economic demands. There will always be demand for food and shelter. There is always demand to make life easier and less boring.</p>
<p>However, in the case of iPhone, we have two views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve Jobs's presentation causes people to want iPhones. Supply creates demand.</li>
<li>People always want an easier way to live. Steve Jobs's iPhone just happens to make people's lives easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: We want an easier way to live. People don't want iPhones for iPhones's sake. People want iPhones because people believe iPhones make people's lives easier.</p>
<p>If demand surges, it will collapse later. Example: tulip mania.</p>
<h4 id="economic-recession"><span class="section_number">11.4.3</span><span class="section_title">Economic recession</span></h4>
<p>Economic recession is the reduction of money flow velocity.</p>
<p>How do we predict recession? How do we measure and monitor money flow velocity?</p>
<ul>
<li>people savings balance</li>
<li>mass layoffs</li>
<li>mass price hikes for vital goods (oil?)</li>
<li>company profit/loss statements</li>
<li>money accumulates at few economic actors</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology introduction, demand shift among substitute goods:</p>
<p>A demand shift is a demand collapse and a demand surge.</p>
<p>Cheaper robotic workers (or increasing minimum wages) causes demand for human workers to collapse and demand for robotic workers to surge.</p>
<p>Demand shifts among substitute goods.</p>
<h4 id="fluid-dynamics-explains-economic-recessions"><span class="section_number">11.4.4</span><span class="section_title">Fluid dynamics explains economic recessions</span></h4>
<p>Economic recession happens because money flow slows down.</p>
<p>Money is a fluid. A fluid flows. Fluid flow velocity depends on pressure at the source and resistances in the path.</p>
<p>If we want to maintain flow velocity despite increasing resistance, we have to increase pressure at the source of the fluid flow. But do we want this?</p>
<p>Money flow slows down because people spend less.</p>
<p>People spend less because they have less discretionary income.</p>
<p>People have less discretionary income because they are fired, or governments raise taxes, or important things get more expensive, etc.</p>
<p>Assumption: A person's behavior changes slowly, if it changes at all. A person who has never cared about the environment will not suddenly care about the environment.</p>
<p>A recession has two possible direct causes: <em>demand collapse</em> or <em>supply collapse</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of supply collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine collapse, oil rig explosion, etc.</li>
<li>Disasters: fire, earthquake, tsunami, flood, volcanic eruption, etc..</li>
<li>Lots of people going out of workforce at once (into pension, dying in war, etc.).</li>
<li>Lots of people suddenly becoming conscious (Google workers demonstrating for transparency, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of demand collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 17th-century tulip mania<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> ran out of fools (greater fool theory).</li>
<li>Renewable energy sources reduce oil demand.</li>
<li>Young people adopt a minimalist lifestyle after realizing that consumerism is unsustainable.</li>
<li>Government increases minimum wage big enough to make switching to robots looks cheap. Lots of companies introduce robot workers at the same time, making human workers redundant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply collapse is caused by physical destruction. Demand collapse is self-inflicted human condition.</p>
<p>Consumers supply demands to producers. Consumers demand supplies from producers. Take and give. To demand is to take, to consume, to destroy. To supply is to give, to produce, to create.</p>
<p>What does inverted yield curve has to do with recession? What does time preference have to do with economic recession? What is an economic recession?</p>
<p>CAGR = compound annualized growth rate.</p>
<p>What is the yield of a bond? A bond's yield is the CAGR of the bond price.</p>

<p>Price is not important in itself. It is the quality-price trade-off that is important. People don't buy shit even if it's cheap, even if you pay them to buy it.</p>
<p>For an increment of quality, people are willing to pay an increment of price. But there is a &quot;good enough&quot; point where people are satisfied and they just look at the lowest price.</p>
<p>Negative price means willingness to pay to get rid of something. Example: rotten vegetables has negative price to most people, but positive price to farmers.</p>

<p>We should measure debt-to-income ratio instead of debt-to-GDP ratio?</p>
<p>Consumptive debt sacrifices future for the present.</p>
<p>Productive debt is good.</p>
<p>Example of productive debt:</p>
<p>Suppose that you want to buy a land to farm on it. These are the scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>You work for 20 years. Then you buy the land with cash. But the land price has risen.</li>
<li>You take a loan, buy the land now, and repay the loan over 10 years. In the second year, your land starts producing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a person takes too much consumptive debt, he goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>If a government takes too much consumptive debt nominated in its own currency, it can print money to repay the debt, but such printing devalues the currency.</p>
<p>If the US continues to take loans mindlessly, it will have to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default (refuse to repay).</li>
<li>Suffer severe inflation (rising prices), if the creditors spend the printed money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the USA think it can get away by refusing to repay its debts? It will trigger a huge power shift, maybe to China. Will China sacrifice itself to clean up America's mess? Will China buy up all US debts, and use the default as a reason to start a war?</p>

<p>There are only two ways to get rich: <em>earn</em> wealth or <em>steal</em> wealth.</p>
<p>Earn wealth: convince people to give you money, by selling them things that improve their lives. Use the money to develop your wealth even more.</p>

<p><em>Money and human</em> can be thought of as <em>seed and soil</em>. Some humans are fertile soils for money to grow. A poor person who wins a lottery soon loses all of it. A rich person who wins a lottery keeps getting richer. A fool and his money are soon parted. However, this way of thinking puts money first and human second. We can think of how fast money flows through a person, similar to how we think of how fast crops grow in a soil. The person's business ability is akin to the soil's fertility.</p>
<p>Money is also a way for people to <em>vote</em> for what they want. People vote with their money. Money is the consumer's vote for what producers should do. Money is the people's vote for what companies should do. Indeed the voice of the people is the voice of God<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>, in politics, and more so in economics, no matter how perverse. <em>The consumers are the masters of the companies,</em> because the consumers are who feed the companies money. Whoever feeds a company is its master. Surprisingly companies are very much like dogs; but companies eat money whereas dogs eat meat. But <em>the consumers collectively have the power to teach<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> the companies</em>, that is, to reward wanted behavior and punish unwanted behavior. The key word is <em>collectively</em>: an individual consumer is powerless, but all those consumers together are the master of the companies, and it is the average behavior of all consumers that is sensed by the companies. Thus a negligent master will produce an untrained dog that litters anywhere it wants and destroys anything it wants. Unfortunately the consumers are divided; they would be strong if they united.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Can we use cognitive behavioral therapy on companies?</em> Can we use the same techniques we use to fix misbehaving dogs? We treat a company as an indivisible psychological entity.</p>
<p>Sometimes, pervertedly, the master depends on the dog, although it is the dog that should depend on the master. This perversion happens in monopolies.</p>
<p>The 21st century environmental destruction has been voted for by the consumers. Companies are merely obeying the wishes of their masters, the consumers. Consumers want quick and cheap. Consumers do not care about how something was made or where something came from.</p>
<p>If consumers cannot or will not care, then the government has to step in to internalize the negative externalities back into the offending firms, and prevent the extinction of those short-sighted consumers.</p>

<p>What to do when an employee asks us about why his salary is what it is?</p>
<p>We must not pretend that we know the answer.</p>
<p>The correct answer is <em>more questions</em>, a coaching activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by that question?</li>
</ul>
<p>Does he simply envy a coworker?</p>
<p>Is he simply a rational person who wants to maximize his salary-to-effort ratio?</p>
<p>Fairness does not exist. What exists is the <em>feeling</em> of being treated unfairly.</p>
<p>Why am I paid a different salary to do the same thing? But what is <em>same</em>?</p>
<p>Salary is <em>price</em>, not value.</p>
<p>Do not conflate <em>price</em> and <em>value</em>.</p>
<p>In order for a business to profit, it must pay employees salary lower than their value. It must buy labor at a lower cost than it sells its products.</p>
<h3 id="economic-crises"><span class="section_number">11.10</span><span class="section_title">Economic crises</span></h3>
<p>A <em>crisis</em> is a mass discontent.</p>
<p>An <em>economic crisis</em> is a mass discontent due to mass reduction of purchasing power.</p>
<p>&quot;A financial crisis is any of a broad variety of situations in which some financial assets suddenly lose a large part of their nominal value.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>High firing rate, high unemployment, unemployed people having genuine difficulty finding jobs, employers not willing to employ</li>
<li>Greatly reduced demand (discretionary spending)</li>
<li>Reduced purchasing power</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do economic crises happen?</p>
<p><em>Some</em> economic crises such as the Great Depression might have been <em>self-fulfilling prophecies</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>People believe that there is a crisis, whereas there is actually none.</li>
<li>People reduce spending, and save more, believing that hard times lie ahead.</li>
<li>Companies profit go down.</li>
<li>Companies lay off workers.</li>
<li>There is now an actual crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, some economic booms might also be self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<ul>
<li>People believe that the economy is doing good, whereas it is actually what it has always been.</li>
<li>People increase spending, and save less, believing that good times lie ahead.</li>
<li>Companies profit go up.</li>
<li>Companies hire more workers.</li>
<li>There is now an actual boom.</li>
</ul>
<p>The government and mass media must maintain public opinion about the economic outlook; we want people to be moderate, cautious, not too pessimistic, not too optimistic.</p>
<p>Some economic crises are due to <em>mismanagement</em>. For example, Venezuela failed to diversify its economy; its government depended too much on its oil exports. Then oil price crashed in 2014, and the Venezuelan economy went down with it, spurring a social crisis in 2018 and the mass exodus of millions of people. Their people have to learn the hard way that there is no free lunch.</p>
<p>&lt;2019-05-18&gt; Another brewing crisis is the excessive property speculation in China, Indonesia, and other Asian countries. The governments must brake property ownership and steer the public opinion away from the widespread false belief that real estate is a safe-and-sure investment. Otherwise, the higher the price goes, the more it hurts when it crashes. Increasing real estate price is not real economic growth. The governments must encourage real economic growth, and discourage &quot;financial growth&quot;, which is just a fancy term for shuffling wealth around.</p>
<p>Nothing is free. If you get something for free, then either someone else has paid for it, or you are the product being sold.</p>
<h2 id="economic-ecology"><span class="section_number">12</span><span class="section_title">Economic ecology</span></h2>
<p>There is an intuitive connection between economy and ecology.</p>
<p>The idea of business ecology goes back to Moore 1996.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Companies in an economy are like organisms in an ecology: some companies consume the output of other companies, and produce another output that is consumed by other companies. The economic development<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> from agricultural to manufacturing to service parallels the ecological succession<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> from desert to grassland to forest. The recovery of an economy after devastation parallels the recovery of an ecology after forest fire<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>. There are pioneer companies, parallel to pioneer species<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Which is more likely?</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers feed companies money, in the same way masters feed dogs meat.</li>
<li>Companies eat customers, in the same way fishes eat planktons.</li>
</ul>
<p>The parallels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organisms eat food to survive. Companies eat money to survive.</li>
<li>pioneer species in biology ~ pioneer species in economics?</li>
<li>ecosystem recovery after wildfire ~ economy recovery after war/disaster?</li>
<li>fire ecology ~ war/disaster ecology?</li>
<li>How does a community rebuild itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>These help a species to thrive: lots of food, little competition, little predation.</p>
<p>Companies can fill niches, in the same way species occupy niches.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, the effort required by a rich person to survive is practically zero. Food is nutritious and cheap. Healthcare is good, but expensive, but rich people can still afford it. The only thing a rich person needs to do to survive is to avoid doing stupid things with all that money.</p>
<p>The life of poor people has pretty much always been the same. However, the most unfortunate are the poor who live in cities. More fortunate than them are the poor people who live at fertile lands, because they can work to eat, because nature always buys everyone's labor and sells food to everyone who works. Nature feeds everyone who works. But city dwellers are not willing to buy the poor people's labor, because city dwellers have no use of them.</p>
<p>The 21st century is the age of <em>irrelevant abundance</em>: There are so many things in this world that we do not want or do not care about. Contrast this to the first days of human existence, when everyone cares about one thing, and one thing only: survival.</p>
<h3 id="economic-systems-are-converging"><span class="section_number">13.2</span><span class="section_title">Economic systems are converging</span></h3>
<p>Economically, the Cold War can be thought of as a world-wide experiment to find out which is better between market economy and command economy. The result is clear: market economy is better than command economy, although not the best.</p>
<p>America began with too much individual freedom. Russia began with too little individual freedom. Both have a problem distributing wealth: America, despite being the most wealthy nation on Earth, has unexpectedly many poor people; meanwhile, Russia's statistical distribution of wealth is too skewed toward the poor side. But they are converging toward the center, where wealth distribution is more balanced but individual freedom is not too much sacrificed. Note that we do <em>not</em> want to <em>flatten</em> the statistical distribution; we merely want to <em>nudge</em> the leftmost part of the distribution toward the right, in order to improve the lives of the poorest people, without stealing from the rich.</p>

<p>These are two <em>different</em> questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does someone become rich or poor?</li>
<li>Why is someone rich or poor?</li>
</ul>
<p>A person becomes rich due to sustained surplus. A person becomes poor due to sustained deficit. A surplus enriches a person. A deficit impoverishes a person. If his expenses consistently exceeds his income, he will become poor.</p>
<p>Is his expenses too high? Is his income too low?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mutual causes, vicious circles; poverty, homelessness</p>
<p>TLDR: Poverty causes homelessness. Homelessness exacerbates poverty.</p>
<p>Which causes which, between poverty and homelessness? To find out, answer both &quot;How does a poor person become homeless?&quot; and &quot;How does a homeless person become poor?&quot;.</p>
<p>If the poor can increase his income, he will be able to buy a home. But to increase his income, he need to have a home (a mailing address) first. It's catch-22.</p>
<p>If the poor can get a home but not increase his income, he will lose the home, and he will be homeless again.</p>
<p>A homeless person doesn't have a mailing address. Thus he can't create a bank account. Thus he can't apply for a job. Thus he has no income. Thus he becomes poor.</p>
<p>A poor person has a house. Thus he needs money to buy food. Thus he sells his house. Thus he becomes homeless. Thus he ends up even poorer.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="political-economics"><span class="section_number">14.9</span><span class="section_title">Political economics</span></h3>
<p>Political economics is economics with some political tinge.</p>
<p>Political ideals cannot escape economic reality. Politicians cannot give everyone free lunch just by making it a law.</p>
<p>We tend to waste free things?</p>
<h3 id="poverty-breeding-and-vicious-circle"><span class="section_number">14.10</span><span class="section_title">Poverty, breeding, and vicious circle</span></h3>
<p>Poor people are poor because their parents are poor. Therefore, poverty can be greatly reduced by preventing poor people from breeding. But what are the unintended consequences?</p>
<h3 id="profit"><span class="section_number">14.11</span><span class="section_title">Profit?</span></h3>
<p>&quot;An ethical justification of profit maximization&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>? What about environmental destruction?</p>
<p>How do we design a scalable incentive system that solves the tragedy of the commons?</p>
<p>If we require every business to restore the part of nature that they exploit, then no business can be profitable?</p>
<p>The problem of the tragedy of the commons is that the feedback is delayed.</p>
<p>Consider cattle farmers and a common grassland.</p>
<p>Traffic jams are also a tragedy of the commons. Everyone exploits the road because it's free.</p>
<p>The same solution can be used to solve overfishing, pollution, climate change, etc..</p>
<p>What is the solution? &quot;Sometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing.&quot; &quot;locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Solutions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Solutions</a></p>
<p>Profit maximization or hassle minimization? Profit is the food a company eats to survive.</p>
<h3 id="scrutinizing-the-law-of-supply-and-demand"><span class="section_number">14.12</span><span class="section_title">Scrutinizing the law of supply and demand</span></h3>
<p>The law of supply and demand can be derived from microeconomics with the assumption of rational actors.</p>
<p>Why does price rise when demand rises faster than supply does? There are several possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supplier is psychologically overwhelmed and wants to reduce demand.</li>
<li>The supplier is greedy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microeconomics gives rise to the law of supply and demand<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-solution-to-overpopulation-is-mass-murder"><span class="section_number">14.13</span><span class="section_title">The solution to overpopulation is mass murder</span></h3>
<p>Either we do it ourselves, or Nature will do it for us.</p>
<p>Only a natural disaster that kills at least half of all people can fix Jakarta traffic problem.</p>
<p>But a mass murder only delays the problem; humans will breed and recover. The only solution that addresses the root cause of the problem is to kill all humans.</p>

            Disqus has been removed because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
            On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website are broken,
            and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.

                    Or, even better, contribute to a community wiki.
