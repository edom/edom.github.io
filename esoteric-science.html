<li>perceived speed of time</li>
<li>aperture of focus</li>
<li>amount of consciousness</li>
<li>big aperture = low focus = low consciousness?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypothesis: The perceived speed of time is <em>inversely related</em> to the amount of consciousness.

<li>Predictions:
<ul>
<li>We feel time passing faster when we sleep.</li>
<li>We feel time passing slower when we are hyperfocused (e.g. on pain).</li>
<li>The perceived speed of time is inversely proportional to the amount of new information?</li>
<li>Null-meditation (<em>not</em> focusing on anything) <em>decreases</em> consciousness?</li>
<li>Single-pointedness meditation (<em>focusing</em> on something) <em>increases</em> consciousness?</li>

<li>Burkhard Bilger? &quot;Time can warp when our brain receives much more or less input than usual in a three-second span. (For example, time slows down when you are about to crash your car, but you can easily lose a whole day watching things on YouTube.)&quot;</li>

<p>Interesting: Google search result for &quot;discarnate scientist&quot; and &quot;discarnate scientists&quot; (both with quotes, for exact match).</p>
<p>We have found that the afterlife exists. Now it is time to find out how to communicate with discarnate beings more efficiently.</p>
<p>Channelers can cooperate with people (spirits) in the afterlife for scientific research.</p>
<p><em>We can ask discarnate beings to do some experiments and report the results to us.</em> Is it linguistically correct to say that a discarnate being is the <em>living remnant</em> of a dead people?</p>
<p>If life does not require a body, what is life?</p>

<h2 id="idea-measuring-the-depth-of-meditation"><span class="section_number">9</span><span class="section_title">Idea: Measuring the depth of meditation</span></h2>
<p>The depth of meditation can be subjectively measured by the <em>rate of internal distraction</em> (number of internal distractions per unit time). For example, a newbie meditator may be distracted 20 times per minute, and an expert meditator may be distracted 1 time per 15 minutes. One internal distraction is one time realizing that one has been distracted. External distraction does not always translate to internal distraction. For example, when someone talks to me while I am reading an article, I may fail to respond to the other person.</p>
<p>The depth of meditation can be objectively measured by frequency analysis of brain waves?</p>

<p>If you read a lot, you will not be enlightened; you will only be an expert at speaking like an enlightened person. The text is to guide a <em>practice</em>, not to be read, not to be intellectualized. The language is a limitation; language cannot transmit experience.</p>
<p>I fell to the trap of intellectualizing enlightenment; I tried to understand it, that is to create a mental model of it, not to know it, that is to directly experience it. I was just feeding my monkey mind with words. That realization enlightened me about enlightenment, but it did not enlighten me.</p>
<p>To learn to emote without language, watch silent movies. But aren't body languages language?</p>
<p>To enlighten is to shine light upon, to dispel darkness, to dispel ignorance, to make someone see. To be enlightened is to know. To know what? Everything.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-consciousness"><span class="section_number">15</span><span class="section_title">Overview of consciousness</span></h2>
<p>Is there any meaningful difference between subconscious and unconscious?</p>
<p>If Consciousness = ability to know (introspectability?) then Subconsciousness = <em>reduced</em> ability to know, and Unconsciousness = inability to know, lack of ability to know.</p>
<p>Cognition and recognition</p>
<p>cogito comes from from con- (from cum-, with) and agito (agere, to do) &lt;2019-11-05&gt; <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogito#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogito#Latin</a></p>
<p>Cognizance, cogitate</p>
<p>Cogito = I think</p>
<p>X recognizes Y iff X cognizes that X cognizes Y.</p>
<p>For example, we see a photo of a distant acquaintance that we last met 40 years ago. We immediately <em>cognize</em> this person, in the sense that we immediately feel that we know this person (we have seen this person somewhere before); but for a moment we strive to think who this person is and where we met this person: it takes us some time to <em>recognize</em> this person.</p>

<p>How accurate is this analogy?</p>
<p>My consciousness, my awareness, my perception of what I think is the present, my existence, is like trying to catch as many fish as possible in a rapid stream of water full of fish swimming along in the current. There are so many fish that my conscious mind does not see. When I silence my mind, it is as if I let the fish swim, not catch them, not interfere with their natural trajectories.</p>
<p>The fish in my hand is my conscious mind.</p>
<p>The fish I glimpse in my peripheral vision is my subconscious mind.</p>
<p>The fish swimming under the water is my unconscious mind.</p>

<li>To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).</li>
<li><p>Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.</p>
<ul>
<li>People filter incoming information.</li>
<li>People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.</li>
<li>Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.</li>

<li>This has a concrete recommendations for countering the firehose of falsehood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trump and Putin use &quot;firehose of falsehood&quot; to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.</li>
<li>The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them. Media should stop giving them a platform. We should refuse to hear them. We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power. We should simply dismiss everything they say. Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.</li>

<ol>
<li><p>What is a friend?</p>
<p>Your friends are those who sacrifice for you. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the friendship. How do we measure a sacrifice?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we measure friendship?</p>
<p>In theory, we define <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> (the <em>friendship measure from A to B</em>) as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.</p>
<p>(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)</p>
<p>Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.</p>
<p>How do we measure friendship in practice?</p>
<p>Foot-in-the-door: let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Door-in-the-face: let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses, and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Those results may differ, but <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> should lie somewhere between those two points. We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum, use interval arithmetics, or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties of friendship</p>
<p>Friendship is circumstantial: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> changes over time.</p>
<p>Friendship is usually asymmetric: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions</p>
<p>What is self-friendship? What is <span class="math inline">\(F(A,A)\)</span>? How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself? Does this question even make sense?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>What is a boss?</p>
<ol>
<li>X is a <em>boss</em> of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.</li>
<li>X is a <em>strong boss</em> of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.</li>
<li>X is a <em>weak boss</em> of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.</li>
<li>Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.</li>
<li>Don't bite the hand that feeds you.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Another definition, based on fear: X is a boss of Y if Y fears X.</p></li>

<h4 id="happiness"><span class="section_number">16.9.3</span><span class="section_title">Happiness</span></h4>
<p>Happiness = Reality - Expectation.</p>
<p>To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.</p>
<p>Pain also reduces happiness.</p>
<p>Money cannot buy happiness, but it can buys things that will make you happier.</p>
<p>Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable, adding money doesn't add happiness.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-17&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>appeal-to-evolution</em> is this argument: <em>If a trait would hamper the survival of a species, then that species would not have evolved that trait.</em></p>
<p>It is a heuristic. It is not always correct. For example, it cannot explain peacock tails. However, it seems reasonable in absence of other information.</p>
<p>The appeal-to-evolution weakens the theory that irregular eating causes gastritis as follows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very early hunter-gatherer humans ate irregularly; they were always a few days away from starvation, they did not have a secure food supply, they depend very much on their surroundings. <em>Having gastritis due to irregular eating would hamper their survival.</em> Therefore they probably evolved such that irregular eating does not cause gastritis.</p>

<p>Conservation of mass.</p>
<p>Body mass is gained by food and drinks, and lost by exhalation and excretion.</p>
<p>The question is the <em>composition</em> of those mass.</p>
<p>If I weigh 70 kg and both my legs weigh 20 kg, then a squat consumes at least 50 kg * 10 m/s2 * 0.5 m = 200 J = 0.0478 kcal. That's a tiny amount relative to the calories in the food we eat! We can easily eat 300 kcal in one meal. Thus, if the human body were 100% efficient, I would have to squat <em>6,276 times</em> to burn that one meal!</p>
<p>Thus the biggest energy consumer is the basal metabolic processes.</p>
<p>The proximal cause is the combination of nutrition and hormones. Hormones are affected by nutrition, activity, and genetics.</p>
<h4 id="a-clean-eating-protocol"><span class="section_number">16.10.7</span><span class="section_title">A clean eating protocol</span></h4>
<p>Combine <em>nutrition science</em> and <em>psychology</em>.</p>
<p>For two weeks.</p>
<p>Pay attention to gut microbiome.</p>
<p>No sugar; no condiments bought from supermarket because they all have sugar. No flour. No carb. No food that is processed more than one step from its original form. No refined foods. No extracts. Sugar is not OK because it is concentrated sugarcane plant extract. Cooked meat is very OK, but sausage is not. White rice is not OK. Green vegetables OK.</p>
<p>Anytime you're hungry, just eat; there is no time restriction; the only restriction is that you eat real fat/protein.</p>
<p>Everytime you eat, you must send a photograph of what you eat to me. It is not for approval, but for commentary, and for <em>psychology</em>, for accountability, so that you feel that you are doing it for me, so that you don't prematurely abandon your effort.</p>
<p>You can drink anything as long it has no sugar in it. Just drink plain water. Drinks from the supermarket are not OK; they all have sugar.</p>

<p>I had a habit of delaying important-but-unpleasant things. I had a habit of avoiding them, running away from them. I had an escapism problem.</p>
<p>A concrete example: I got a new phone, but I was too lazy to port my old SIM card due to different form factors; so I got a family member's unused SIM card. Thus I used my old phone much less frequently. Then I forget to pay the phone company which then killed my old number. I had to tell my contacts that I changed my phone number. I had to go to the bank to update my account. Much hassle.</p>
<p>Some delayed problems begat bigger problems. I never thought about that.</p>
<p>I hated the phone company, so I blamed the phone company.</p>
<p>I hated going to the bank.</p>
<p>But then I thought, perhaps it was the Universe's way of telling me that that habit was bad for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could meditate while waiting at the bank.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a good chance to learn equanimity.</p>
<p>The same habit also causes my browser to have hundreds of open tabs. I thought that a link was pointing to an interesting document, so I clicked on it. But I thought that it was unpleasant to actually read the document. I liked imagination and hated reality; I liked to imagine myself understanding the document, but I hated to actually read it.</p>
<p>I know another friend of mine who has the same problem of too many open tabs.</p>
<p>My life would be much easier if I killed the problem while it was small.</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the difference between science and Scientism.
<ul>
<li>Scientism is a religion like Christianity, Islam, etc. Dogmatic.</li>
<li>There are no fixed beliefs in science (except perhaps that we know that we do not know). On the other hand, Scientism adherents have fixed beliefs in mainstream science.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Understand the difference between skeptics and pseudoskeptics.</li>
<li>Understand that materialism has advanced us greatly but it can help us no further.</li>
</ul>
<p>Science can and should be used to investigate afterlife, spirituality, religion, and paranormal phenomena.</p>
<p>We are doing science wrong. Science should advance faster than one funeral at a time. Funding should be more random.</p>
<p>Why do we strive to study things as far as the moon, if we have never even studied things as near as our own minds?</p>
<p>Esoteric and exoteric science should be merged into a more complete science.</p>
<p><em>Practice</em> is important. Avoid getting so immersed in trying to read all esoteric literatures that you forget to practice anything. Choose one that <em>resonates</em> with you, and practice it. For me, it's scientific esotericism.</p>

<p>How do we think that we deserve wealth without being an affluenza person?</p>
<p>These are different: to think that we deserve wealth, and to think that we don't deserve poverty.</p>
<p>To me, &quot;X deserves Y&quot; means &quot;It is good that X has Y&quot;, for whatever definition of &quot;good&quot; you subscribe to.</p>

<p>There are psychological experiments and theories that try to explain those experiments, but do those theories predict anything?</p>
<p>Is psychology falsifiable?</p>
<p>There are some interesting experiments and applications. Asch conformity experiment, Stanford prison experiment. Using stories to change minds. Hostage negotiation techniques. Pavlovian conditioning, Skinnerian conditioning. Rat heaven experiment. Monkey mother experiment.</p>
<p><em>But what is the underlying science?</em> Biology, genetics, hormones, epigenetics, neuroscience, and so on.</p>

<p>Pam Grout's 2013 book (&quot;[…] Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments […]&quot;) gives some spiritual experiments that everyone can do on their own. But there are lots of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1401938906/?filterByStar=critical&amp;pageNumber=1">damning reviews</a>, so I did not read the book. But there are some positive reviews too. I should decide for myself.</p>
<h3 id="idea-a-system-is-an-embodied-intention"><span class="section_number">18.12</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2020-01-01&gt; Idea: A system is an embodied intention</span></h3>
<p>Establish an organization with an intention. People with the same intentions resonate and contribute to the organization. Example: Wikipedia is the embodiment of the intention of creating an encyclopedia (summary of mainstream materials).</p>
<p>To manifest an intention, <em>embody</em> that intention: give that intention a body, create a body with that intention. Establish an organization? Establish a group? Create a system?</p>
<p>Global intention is manifested by <em>resonance</em> among like-minded people.</p>
<p>Two people <em>resonate</em> iff they have the same intention.</p>
<h3 id="questions-on-manifesting-lower-mind-vs-higher-mind"><span class="section_number">18.13</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2020-01-01&gt; Questions on manifesting; lower mind vs higher mind</span></h3>
<p>Why can't I just sit down and &quot;will my way&quot; to anything? Why can't I just sit down, totally believe that I have a car, and make a car pop out of nowhere?</p>
<p><em>Or can I?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps, deep down, my subconscious disbelief is stronger than my conscious belief? Or perhaps &quot;I&quot; am not what I think I am? When I think &quot;I am willing a car&quot;, it is my mind that is willing, not I that is willing.</p>
<p>Idea for some &quot;enlightenment&quot; via writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I, me, my, myself = what I am; &quot;higher mind&quot;</li>
<li>'I', 'me', 'my', 'myself' = what my mind thinks I am; &quot;lower mind&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I am manifesting, but from 'my' point of view, 'I' am not manifesting, because that is true: it is I, not 'I', who is manifesting. So how can 'I' know myself and what I am thinking? 'I' is mired so deep in its illusion of what 'I' think I am. 'I' have brain, but I don't have brain, so how do I know, and how do I communicate with 'me'? How come that I and 'I' are one but different?</p>
<h3 id="imagination-is-real"><span class="section_number">18.14</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2020-01-01&gt; Imagination is real</span></h3>
<p>Imagination is undoubtedly real, at least subjectively. We do not doubt that our imagination exists. It is just that we don't know how to mix our imagination and reality; we don't know how to embody our imagination.</p>
<p>Effort is the progress of embodying an imagination? We embody imagination by giving energy to it?</p>
<p>What is subjectively real? Everything you &quot;see&quot; is, by definition, subjectively real. This includes perception, hallucination, dream.</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;2020-01-21&gt; I think it is ironic that to find aliens we must go <em>inwards</em>, not outwards like the SETI project. Of course SETI finds nothing; it assumes that a 200-year old physical model is reality; its engineering may be new, but it ignores 200 years of recent science; it is looking at the wrong place, like looking for fish in in the sky! <em>The spiritual researchers have found the aliens</em>, and they do not use your 19th-century electromagnetic radiation; they manipulate spacetime! The SETI project is a misguided waste of effort and should be aborted right now, and all its funding should be given to spiritual/consciousness researchers, such as the FREE foundation! It's too late to have reservations about contacting aliens; <em>the aliens themselves are contacting us</em>!</li>

<li>A spirit has identity and a sense of self, a boundary, very much as an incarnate knows what is part of his body and what is not. It's just harder for spirits to manipulate materials.</li>

                    I used Disqus, but I removed it because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
                    and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
