<ul>
<li>Concordance of terms
<ul>
<li>Monroe's Second Body = pure consciousness?</li>
<li>Monroe's Second State = Campbell's Non Physical Matter Reality?</li>
<li>Monroe's Locale 1 = astral plane?
<ul>
<li>= <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">bardo</a>?</li>
<li>= Campbell's high entropy state?</li>
<li>= kamaloka/kamadhatu? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailokya">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailokya</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The space of thoughts, where thoughts are primary and tangible?</li>
<li>Travel is almost instantaneous and is done by intending to the destination; does not seem to be affected by ordinary distance.</li>
<li>The tiniest stray thought causes one to get lost.</li>
<li>This seems to be hell for those who cannot quiet their minds.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Locale 2</li>
<li>Locale 3 feels too good?</li>
<li>TODO: Compare with bardo thodol, Buddhist/Hindu realms of heavens and hells, other eschatology, etc.
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis: The boundary between two adjacent realms is fuzzy and not crisp, like the boundary between troposphere and stratosphere. Sorites paradox.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapter 16
<ul>
<li>Condition A
<ul>
<li>Monroe's &quot;fixative&quot; = &quot;mantra&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Monroe's Condition C = Patanjali's pratyahara
<ul>
<li>Thus pratyahara happens when one stays awake at the edge between awake and asleep. The key is to stay awake in this almost-asleep state.</li>
<li>Yoga practitioners can sleep while sitting!?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Condition D = Condition C but in a fresh state instead of a tired state</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare Monroe's exercises with this writing <a href="http://hermeticlessons.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-wmt-astral-plane-ii.html">http://hermeticlessons.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-wmt-astral-plane-ii.html</a></li>

<li>&quot;We arrive at a new place, simultaneously with the intention to be there.&quot;</li>

<h2 id="on-meditation"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2020-02-16&gt; On meditation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: gain the ability to fix your attention on a thought of your choice for a few minutes, with eyes closed, while not moving any muscles, and letting but not following every other thought that arises.</li>
<li>Stage 2: gain the ability to quiet the mind by using Stage 1 to fix your attention on a mantra as a crutch. A mantra is a simple repetitive thought that &quot;flushes out&quot; (&quot;drowns out&quot;) other thoughts. A mantra can be visual, aural, kinesthetic, or a combination of them. A mantra is a temporary crutch for quieting the mind.</li>
<li>Stage 3: discard the mantra from Stage 2, and be able to quiet the mind at will whenever you want, be it with eyes open or closed, be it in a noisy environment or a quiet one.</li>

<ul>
<li>I have read the book, but I understood little of it.
<ul>
<li>I think people should skip the book, and visit the <a href="https://wiki.my-big-toe.com/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a> and <a href="https://www.my-big-toe.com/forums/index.php">forum</a> instead.</li>
<li>I think Tom Campbell should release one version of his TOE for people who are not afraid of math.
<ul>
<li>Reverse the explanation. Start from PMR, then NPMR, then OS, etc.</li>
<li>Use math.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tom Campbell's unique perspective is that he is familiar with both physics and out-of-body experiences.</li>
<li>Read Ben Iscatus's 2009 <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/iscatusben/review-of-my-big-t">review</a>.</li>
<li>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCE5EA05F1F683940">London lecture</a> and read the <a href="https://www.my-big-toe.com/uploads/LondonLectureSlides.pdf">slides</a>.

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrpIAbFZucU&amp;list=PLCE5EA05F1F683940&amp;index=13">5:39</a>: How to meditate:
<ul>
<li>Meditation technique is highly individual.</li>
<li>A mantra can be anything you invent.</li>
<li>The purpose of a mantra is to drive other thoughts away.</li>
<li>If you have become able to control your mind at will without the mantra, you can throw away the mantra.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reading time estimate:
<ul>
<li>820 pages * 40 lines per page * 16 words per line ~ 524,800 words</li>
<li>/ 100 words per minute ~ 5,248 minutes ~ 87 hours</li>
<li>/ 4 hours per day ~ 22 days</li>
<li>It will probably take <em>a month</em> to read the entire trilogy. That book is crazy long; it could use fewer words.</li>

<li>What if someone finds a programming error in the simulation and exploits it to crash the simulation?</li>

<li>The logical next step is perhaps to show that this theory subsumes 21st century physics, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity.</li>

<ul>
<li>I think it is ironic that to find aliens we must go <em>inwards</em>, not outwards like the SETI project. Of course SETI finds nothing; it assumes that a 200-year old physical model is reality; its engineering may be new, but it ignores 200 years of recent science; it is looking at the wrong place, like looking for fish in in the sky! <em>The spiritual researchers have found the aliens</em>, and they do not use your 19th-century electromagnetic radiation; they manipulate spacetime! The SETI project is a misguided waste of effort and should be aborted right now, and all its funding should be given to spiritual/consciousness researchers, such as the FREE foundation! It's too late to have reservations about contacting aliens; <em>the aliens themselves are contacting us</em>!</li>

<p>From <a href="https://jackkornfield.com/awakening-to-pure-consciousness/">Jack Kornfield</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] My detachment had been a withdrawal from the pain and conflict into a protective shell. It was more like indifference. In Buddhist psychology indifference is called the “near enemy” to true openness and equanimity, a misguided imitation. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the difference between equanimity and apathy?</p>
<p>equanimity = treating all feelings equally calmly</p>
<p>apathy = not feeling anything at all; emotional numbness</p>
<p>An equanimous person feels feelings but does not identify with those feelings.</p>
<p>An apathetic person feels nothing.</p>
<p>The ego can make you think that you have killed it. The symptoms are good feelings that are seemingly real but actually fake.</p>
<p>Thus, seek direct experience, not intellect.</p>

<p>When teaching adults, the teacher must clearly state that mistakes are appreciated, and shame must not be feared.</p>
<p>Adults fear shame. Children do not.</p>
<p>Adults do not fear failure. They fear shame.</p>
<p>Adults can learn faster than children do, but adults cripple themselves by fearing mistakes.</p>
<p>Adults are smarter than children, in the sense that adults have more background knowledge that can be used to learn new things faster, but at the same time adults are more stupid than children, because adults cripple themselves by their unnecessary fear of shame of making mistakes.</p>
<p>Adults are smarter than children because adults can think more, but adults are more stupid than children because adults think too much unnecessary thoughts.</p>
<p>Children think too little; adults think too much. Children don't think what they should think. Adults think what they don't need to think.</p>
<p>Children fear too little; adults fear too much.</p>

<p>In a capitalist society, companies enslave workers.</p>
<p>In a communist society, the state enslaves workers.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In an anarchistic society, powerful people enslave workers.</p>
<p>Thus, in all societies of various ideologies and systems, the powerful entities enslave the powerless entities. All societies are suffering from centralization of power. On the other hand, if power is not centralized, then anyone can take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>The only way out of slavery is that every human must see others as he sees himself. If he can see others as he sees himself, he will treat others as he treats himself, and he will love others as he loves himself. Nothing outside humans is going to erase slavery. No system is going to erase slavery. No law is going to erase slavery. Even after all work has been relegated to machines, slavery will continue to exist as long as a human does not see others as he sees himself.</p>
<p>If all humans have universal love, then anarchy is the best society: they will not do evil even if there are no laws.</p>
<p>If every human loves others as he loves himself, he will not hurt others as he will not hurt himself; he will not steal from others as he does not steal from himself; he will not kill others as he will not kill himself.</p>
<p>Universal love is required for anarchy to work.</p>
<p>If we have universal love, then anarchy is the best society.</p>
<p>The thing that we must fix is not countries or companies.</p>
<p><em>We</em> ourselves are what we must fix.</p>

<ul>
<li>Consciousness is more fundamental than matter.
<ul>
<li><em>Terminal lucidity</em> suggests consciousness-first brain-second.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spirits have identity, personality, memory, agency, free will.
<ul>
<li>The evidence is drop-in communicators</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spirits are somehow able to manipulate candle flames? How?</li>
<li>Spirits have memory. They remember the context in a conversation. They remember past conservations.
<ul>
<li>We can ask spirits to remember a phrase and recite it later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But how can they have memory or state if their time is non-linear? Do they have time?</li>
<li>EVP is an electronic phenomenon, not an electroacoustic phenomenon.
<ul>
<li>Spirits begin answering when the asker <em>begins</em> reading, not after the asker <em>finishes</em> reading.</li>
<li>Spirits communicate with thoughts. The question is thought before it is said.</li>
<li>Does EVP require microphones? Experiment: Use Audacity to record noise without microphones plugged in. Invite spirits. Are there sounds?</li>
<li>Spirits manipulate electricity directly.</li>
<li>Question: Do spirits prefer to manipulate analog or digital data? Which is easier for them?</li>
<li>Hypothesis:
<ul>
<li>Spirits manipulate the analog electrical signal that is the input of the sound chip's ADC.</li>
</ul>
Does the waveform show up when you <em>are</em> recording, or after you <em>stop</em> recording? If the former, then this. If the latter, then spirits manipulate the bits in RAM or hard disk.
<ul>
<li>Spirits do not manipulate the charge of the DRAM capacitors.</li>
<li>Spirits do not manipulate the magnetic field on hard disk surfaces.</li>
<li>Spirits do not manipulate the bits in SSDs (solid-state drives)? How do SSDs store data?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.oberf.org/evp.htm">Uday from South Australia</a> claims &quot;Messages can be recorded directly in computer with and without any injection of white noise. There is no need for any microphone at all for EVP recording.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Must we use our native language for spirit communication, even if we are fluent in our second language?</li>
<li>Spirits can direct/manipulate animals to send messages. <a href="http://www.groundedpsychic.com/post/2019/01/04/animal-signs-sent-from-your-loved-ones">http://www.groundedpsychic.com/post/2019/01/04/animal-signs-sent-from-your-loved-ones</a></li>

<p>Discarnate scientists/researchers, and cooperating with discarnate beings in scientific experiments:</p>
<p>Interesting: Google search result for &quot;discarnate scientist&quot; and &quot;discarnate scientists&quot; (both with quotes, for exact match).</p>
<p>We have found that the afterlife exists. Now it is time to find out how to communicate with discarnate beings more efficiently.</p>
<p>Channelers can cooperate with people (spirits) in the afterlife for scientific research.</p>
<p><em>We can ask discarnate beings to do some experiments and report the results to us.</em> Is it linguistically correct to say that a discarnate being is the <em>living remnant</em> of a dead people?</p>
<p>If life does not require a body, what is life?</p>
<p>But first we have to know how to communicate with discarnate beings.</p>
<p>Perhaps &quot;death&quot; should be redefined to &quot;disembodiment&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;he died&quot;, we say &quot;he shed his body&quot;.</p>

<p>The hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our spirit knows everything.</li>
<li>We want to test ourselves, or God wants to test us?</li>
<li>We adopt a physical body and God conceals our memories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point of forgetting is that, if we truly come from God, then, even without memory, we will return to God?</p>

<p>From relativity, we know length contraction and time dilation. If we cannot know who is moving, how do we know who has slower time?</p>
<p>Light does not experience spacetime. Light does not experience anything. From the point of view of a photon, nothing exists other than itself. All photons have the same experience. Thus there is exactly one photon in the Universe?</p>

<h3 id="vibration-more-fundamental-than-time"><span class="section_number">30.3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2020-02-09&gt; Vibration more fundamental than time?</span></h3>
<p>Usually, to know whether something is vibrating, we have to watch the motion of that thing through time. In this view, time is more fundamental than vibration.</p>
<p>But there is the unusual reverse idea that vibration creates time. In this view, it is presumed that things vibrate, and it is assumed that the time perceived by that thing is related to its vibration frequency. In this view, vibration is more fundamental than time.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: felt time is vibration period.</p>
<p>How can we hear a sound without time?</p>
<p>Suppose that vibration is fundamental.</p>
<p>The old view: We know that something is vibrating because we see its moving through spacetime.</p>
<p>We know time passes because we perceive change around us. Even if we deprive our sensors, we still know time passes because we perceive our heartbeats and internal bodily changes. If we don't perceive anything, not even our body, then time won't exist. If we are pure awareness that is aware of only our own existence and nothing else, not even time, then time does not exist.</p>
<p>We do not <em>know</em> the passage of time. We only <em>infer</em> the passage of time from our perception of the changes around us.</p>
<p>We do not experience time directly.</p>
<p>The passage of time is an illusion created by the ordering of our perceptions.</p>
<p>Why and how do we order our perceptions? How can we order our perceptions without time?</p>
<p>But time feels so real! How do we see what is behind this veil of illusion? By null-domain meditation?</p>
<p>If time is an illusion, then what is real?</p>

<p>We hate people because we don't know that <em>they are suffering</em>.</p>
<p>If I know that people misbehave because they are suffering, how can I hate them?</p>
<p><em>Knowing the suffering of others turns your hatred into compassion.</em></p>
<p>I hated my neighbor for her incompetence, but then I found out that her husband died rather young from cancer, she had hyperthyroidism, and she had been shitting 5 times a day everyday. I couldn't keep hating her after I knew her suffering.</p>
<p>I hated Donald Trump, Anies Baswedan, and other politicians, but they may be suffering from loneliness. If I find out what they are suffering from, I'm sure I won't be able to keep hating them.</p>
<p>The saddest people are those hurting themselves: the people who desire to get more than enough. Greedy people suffer like people whose thirst cannot be quenched by any amount of water. They are suffering, and, the saddest thing is that they don't know that they are causing their own suffering.</p>
<p>How do we sympathize without condescension?</p>
<p>Everyone suffers. Rich people, poor people, all suffer. Satan suffers. The Devil suffers. Does God suffer?</p>
<p>Compassion does not mean letting bad things be.</p>
<p>&quot;Compassion&quot; means &quot;suffering together&quot; (feeling the suffering of others).</p>
<p>There are people who do evil because they <em>want</em> to, not because they have to? In what sense are they suffering?</p>
<p>If I am grateful for my body / happy with my body, in what sense am I suffering?</p>
<p>If I am happy with the entirety of my material existence, in what sense am I suffering?</p>
<p>It seems that the material world is a system designed to perpetuate suffering.</p>
<p>If we know everyone's suffering, we cannot hate anyone.</p>
<p>The reason behind all evil deed is that the evil doer is suffering.</p>
<p>However, compassion only prevents hatred, and does not encourage love.</p>
<p>How do we love others unconditionally without resorting to the compassion crutch?</p>
<p>Compassion may be an useful intermediate stage.</p>
<p>hatred -&gt; compassion -&gt; love?</p>
<p>When I have compassion, I stop hating people, but I don't start <em>loving</em> them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only way to love people is to <em>just be and do not overintellectualize</em>.</p>

<p>Every time we breathe out, we let go of our breath.</p>
<p>Every time we poop or breathe out, we don't make a big deal of them.</p>
<p>Every time we poop, we feel joy and release.</p>
<p>We should let go of everything in the same way we let go our poop?</p>

<p>We know we are focused at a single point if we become aware that it is all we are aware of, and we become unaware of everything else, including our own internal bodily sensations.</p>
<h3 id="idea-measuring-the-depth-of-meditation"><span class="section_number">39.2</span><span class="section_title">Idea: Measuring the depth of meditation</span></h3>
<p>The depth of meditation can be subjectively measured by the <em>rate of internal distraction</em> (number of internal distractions per unit time). For example, a newbie meditator may be distracted 20 times per minute, and an expert meditator may be distracted 1 time per 15 minutes. One internal distraction is one time realizing that one has been distracted. External distraction does not always translate to internal distraction. For example, when someone talks to me while I am reading an article, I may fail to respond to the other person.</p>
<p>The depth of meditation can be objectively measured by frequency analysis of brain waves?</p>

<p>If you read a lot, you will not be enlightened; you will only be an expert at speaking like an enlightened person. The text is to guide a <em>practice</em>, not to be read, not to be intellectualized. The language is a limitation; language cannot transmit experience.</p>
<p>I fell to the trap of intellectualizing enlightenment; I tried to understand it, that is to create a mental model of it, not to know it, that is to directly experience it. I was just feeding my monkey mind with words. That realization enlightened me about enlightenment, but it did not enlighten me.</p>
<p>To learn to emote without language, watch silent movies. But aren't body languages language?</p>
<p>To enlighten is to shine light upon, to dispel darkness, to dispel ignorance, to make someone see. To be enlightened is to know. To know what? Everything.</p>

<li>Do not run away from uncomfortable emotions, but <em>meditate on them</em>, and you will find their root cause. For example: sometimes envy, lust, and sloth arise in me. Note the language: &quot;I envy&quot; vs &quot;envy arises in me&quot;.
<ul>
<li>In meditation, we ask the question, and then we quiet our mind and wait for the answer. The answers do not have to come in a language. Some memories may arise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thoughts and feeling are the language of spirits? But the brain interferes with its habits, its programming, its memories?
<ul>
<li>Spiritual signals are much weaker than material signals; we must be very quiet and sensitive.

<li>Why do spirits seem so weak? Or are they actually strong? Because E = mc2: a piece of matter is <em>a lot</em> of congealed energy? If spirits gain more energy, they congeal into matter?</li>

<p>(There is no need to argue further? Enough people are leaving materialism?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Science is stuck, after two centuries of running away from having to deal with consciousness.</li>
<li>To progress, science must deal with consciousness.</li>
<li>Scientists who want progress will leave materialism on their own.</li>
<li>What we need is a <em>safe space</em> for fringe science.</li>
<li>All mainstream science was once fringe science.</li>
<li>There should be no taboo in science.</li>
<li>There should be no taboo object of study.</li>
</ul>
<p>Curriculum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the difference between science and Scientism.
<ul>
<li>Scientism is a religion like Christianity, Islam, etc. Dogmatic.</li>
<li>There are no fixed beliefs in science (except perhaps that we know that we do not know). On the other hand, Scientism adherents have fixed beliefs in mainstream science.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Understand the difference between skeptics and pseudoskeptics.</li>
<li>Understand that materialism has advanced us greatly but it can help us no further.</li>
</ul>
<p>Science can and should be used to investigate afterlife, spirituality, religion, and paranormal phenomena.</p>
<p>We are doing science wrong. Science should advance faster than one funeral at a time. Funding should be more random.</p>
<p>Why do we strive to study things as far as the moon, if we have never even studied things as near as our own minds?</p>
<p>Esoteric and exoteric science should be merged into a more complete science.</p>
<p><em>Practice</em> is important. Avoid getting so immersed in trying to read all esoteric literatures that you forget to practice anything. Choose one that <em>resonates</em> with you, and practice it. For me, it's scientific esotericism.</p>

<p>&quot;Spirit&quot; <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/spirit">means</a> breath. &quot;Spirit&quot; may also mean idea, essence, intention, or meaning, such as in &quot;spirit of the law&quot;, as opposed to &quot;letter of the law&quot;, which is the mere appearance. Greek pneuma.</p>
<h3 id="consciousness"><span class="section_number">41.3</span><span class="section_title">Consciousness</span></h3>
<p><em>Consciousness</em> is the ability to ken. For more explanation, see <a href="conscious.html">file:conscious.html</a>.</p>
<p>Is there any meaningful difference between subconscious and unconscious?</p>
<p>If Consciousness = ability to know (introspectability?) then Subconsciousness = <em>reduced</em> ability to know, and Unconsciousness = inability to know, lack of ability to know.</p>
<p>Cognition and recognition</p>
<p>cogito comes from from con- (from cum-, with) and agito (agere, to do) &lt;2019-11-05&gt; <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogito#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogito#Latin</a></p>

<p>Cogito = I think</p>
<p>X recognizes Y iff X cognizes that X cognizes Y.</p>
<p>For example, we see a photo of a distant acquaintance that we last met 40 years ago. We immediately <em>cognize</em> this person, in the sense that we immediately feel that we know this person (we have seen this person somewhere before); but for a moment we strive to think who this person is and where we met this person: it takes us some time to <em>recognize</em> this person.</p>

<p>Possibly enlightenment?<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Note that the subjects themselves do not label the experience as &quot;enlightenment&quot;, but apparently all of them at least experience temporary ego death.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagine something so fun that I lost sense of time (1–2 hours had passed, whereas I think it was only 15–30 minutes). Is that ego death? But I don't feel extreme bliss.</p>

<li>The viewer's consciousness goes to the target.</li>
<li>The viewer and the target communicate by telepathy.</li>
<li>The viewer reads some Akashic records about the target.</li>

<li>Trump and Putin use &quot;firehose of falsehood&quot; to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.</li>
<li>The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them. Media should stop giving them a platform. We should refuse to hear them. We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power. We should simply dismiss everything they say.

<h3 id="artificial"><span class="section_number">45.2</span><span class="section_title">Artificial?</span></h3>
<p>We say that something is &quot;artificial&quot; iff it is highly unlikely to exist without being created by a human. We say that something is &quot;natural&quot; iff it is not artificial. But, if artificial urea and natural urea are exactly the same thing with the same properties, why do we bother?</p>
<p>Why do we assume that some things will not come into existence if there are no humans to create it?</p>
<p>Is it possible that somewhere out there in the vast outer space, there is a jet aircraft formed spontaneously by natural processes such as explosion of stars?</p>
<p>Is it possible that there is a teapot-shaped space rock formed by natural processes?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is a friend?</p>
<p>Your friends are those who sacrifice for you. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the friendship. How do we measure a sacrifice?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we measure friendship?</p>
<p>In theory, we define <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> (the <em>friendship measure from A to B</em>) as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.</p>
<p>(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)</p>
<p>Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.</p>
<p>How do we measure friendship in practice?</p>
<p>Foot-in-the-door: let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Door-in-the-face: let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses, and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Those results may differ, but <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> should lie somewhere between those two points. We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum, use interval arithmetics, or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties of friendship</p>
<p>Friendship is circumstantial: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> changes over time.</p>
<p>Friendship is usually asymmetric: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions</p>
<p>What is self-friendship? What is <span class="math inline">\(F(A,A)\)</span>? How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself? Does this question even make sense?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>What is a boss?</p>
<ol>
<li>X is a <em>boss</em> of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.</li>
<li>X is a <em>strong boss</em> of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.</li>
<li>X is a <em>weak boss</em> of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.</li>
<li>Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.</li>
<li>Don't bite the hand that feeds you.</li>

<li><p>Another definition, based on fear: X is a boss of Y if Y fears X.</p></li>

<p>Happiness = Reality - Expectation.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-17&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>appeal-to-evolution</em> is this argument: <em>If a trait would hamper the survival of a species, then that species would not have evolved that trait.</em></p>
<p>It is a heuristic. It is not always correct. For example, it cannot explain peacock tails. However, it seems reasonable in absence of other information.</p>
<p>The appeal-to-evolution weakens the theory that irregular eating causes gastritis as follows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very early hunter-gatherer humans ate irregularly; they were always a few days away from starvation, they did not have a secure food supply, they depend very much on their surroundings. <em>Having gastritis due to irregular eating would hamper their survival.</em> Therefore they probably evolved such that irregular eating does not cause gastritis.</p>

<p>Conservation of mass.</p>
<p>Body mass is gained by food and drinks, and lost by exhalation and excretion.</p>
<p>The question is the <em>composition</em> of those mass.</p>
<p>If I weigh 70 kg and both my legs weigh 20 kg, then a squat consumes at least 50 kg * 10 m/s2 * 0.5 m = 200 J = 0.0478 kcal. That's a tiny amount relative to the calories in the food we eat! We can easily eat 300 kcal in one meal. Thus, if the human body were 100% efficient, I would have to squat <em>6,276 times</em> to burn that one meal!</p>
<p>Thus the biggest energy consumer is the basal metabolic processes.</p>
<p>The proximal cause is the combination of nutrition and hormones. Hormones are affected by nutrition, activity, and genetics.</p>
<h4 id="a-clean-eating-protocol"><span class="section_number">45.4.7</span><span class="section_title">A clean eating protocol</span></h4>
<p>Combine <em>nutrition science</em> and <em>psychology</em>.</p>
<p>For two weeks.</p>
<p>Pay attention to gut microbiome.</p>
<p>No sugar; no condiments bought from supermarket because they all have sugar. No flour. No carb. No food that is processed more than one step from its original form. No refined foods. No extracts. Sugar is not OK because it is concentrated sugarcane plant extract. Cooked meat is very OK, but sausage is not. White rice is not OK. Green vegetables OK.</p>
<p>Anytime you're hungry, just eat; there is no time restriction; the only restriction is that you eat real fat/protein.</p>
<p>Everytime you eat, you must send a photograph of what you eat to me. It is not for approval, but for commentary, and for <em>psychology</em>, for accountability, so that you feel that you are doing it for me, so that you don't prematurely abandon your effort.</p>
<p>You can drink anything as long it has no sugar in it. Just drink plain water. Drinks from the supermarket are not OK; they all have sugar.</p>

<p>I had a habit of delaying important-but-unpleasant things. I had a habit of avoiding them, running away from them. I had an escapism problem.</p>
<p>A concrete example: I got a new phone, but I was too lazy to port my old SIM card due to different form factors; so I got a family member's unused SIM card. Thus I used my old phone much less frequently. Then I forget to pay the phone company which then killed my old number. I had to tell my contacts that I changed my phone number. I had to go to the bank to update my account. Much hassle.</p>
<p>Some delayed problems begat bigger problems. I never thought about that.</p>
<p>I hated the phone company, so I blamed the phone company.</p>
<p>I hated going to the bank.</p>
<p>But then I thought, perhaps it was the Universe's way of telling me that that habit was bad for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could meditate while waiting at the bank.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a good chance to learn equanimity.</p>
<p>The same habit also causes my browser to have hundreds of open tabs. I thought that a link was pointing to an interesting document, so I clicked on it. But I thought that it was unpleasant to actually read the document. I liked imagination and hated reality; I liked to imagine myself understanding the document, but I hated to actually read it.</p>
<p>I know another friend of mine who has the same problem of too many open tabs.</p>
<p>My life would be much easier if I killed the problem while it was small.</p>
<p>Perhaps the dead phone number is to teach me to <em>reach out</em>. So far, people had been reaching out to me, but I had never reached out to them.</p>

<p>To me, &quot;X deserves Y&quot; means &quot;It is good that X has Y&quot;, for whatever definition of &quot;good&quot; you subscribe to.</p>

<h3 id="questions-on-manifesting-lower-mind-vs-higher-mind"><span class="section_number">48.3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2020-01-01&gt; Questions on manifesting; lower mind vs higher mind</span></h3>
<p>Why can't I just sit down and &quot;will my way&quot; to anything? Why can't I just sit down, totally believe that I have a car, and make a car pop out of nowhere?</p>
<p><em>Or can I?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps, deep down, my subconscious disbelief is stronger than my conscious belief? Or perhaps &quot;I&quot; am not what I think I am? When I think &quot;I am willing a car&quot;, it is my mind that is willing, not I that is willing.</p>
<p>Idea for some &quot;enlightenment&quot; via writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I, me, my, myself = what I am; &quot;higher mind&quot;</li>
<li>'I', 'me', 'my', 'myself' = what my mind thinks I am; &quot;lower mind&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I am manifesting, but from 'my' point of view, 'I' am not manifesting, because that is true: it is I, not 'I', who is manifesting. So how can 'I' know myself and what I am thinking? 'I' is mired so deep in its illusion of what 'I' think I am. 'I' have brain, but I don't have brain, so how do I know, and how do I communicate with 'me'? How come that I and 'I' are one but different?</p>

<p>A spirit can think and feel without body. So what is a body for?</p>
<h3 id="god-and-us"><span class="section_number">48.5</span><span class="section_title">God and us?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>If God and us are one, then it does not make sense for us to pray to God, in the same way it does not not make sense for us to tell ourselves about ourselves, because we already know ourselves.</li>

<li>Spirits can go/be anywhere in a blink just by thinking/willing.</li>
<li>Spirits can increase their probability of being perceived by changing their appearance to one that resonates with the recipient.
<ul>
<li>Spirits do everything, including changing their form, by willing/thinking/wanting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A spirit has identity and a sense of self, a boundary, very much as an incarnate knows what is part of his body and what is not. It's just harder for spirits to manipulate materials.</li>
<li>He &quot;could split off and be in multiple places at the same time, and it happened naturally, like breathing when I was alive&quot;. (p. 55)</li>
<li>&quot;The weird thing is that if there were twenty people talking about me, those twenty conversations came right to me all at once, even if they were talking about me to somebody else. Not only did I hear everyone’s inner thoughts but I also <em>felt</em> their emotions&quot;</li>
<li>It seems that we can &quot;connect to&quot; or &quot;touch&quot; (send a message to) a spirit just by thinking about it. How does the other direction work? It seems spirit induce/plant thoughts/feelings when our mind is quiet?</li>

<ul>
<li>Some commenters claim that Butler is a fraud.</li>
<li>Apparently Butler jacked up her prices after she rose to fame.</li>
<li>It could be that Butler does have the ability but mixes it with some fraud to get more money, as is common with medium claimants.</li>

<p>Pam Grout's 2013 book (&quot;[…] Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments […]&quot;) gives some spiritual experiments that everyone can do on their own. But there are lots of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1401938906/?filterByStar=critical&amp;pageNumber=1">damning reviews</a>, so I did not read the book. But there are some positive reviews too. I should decide for myself.</p>
