<p>Science can and should be used to investigate afterlife, spirituality, religion, and paranormal phenomena.</p>
<p>Materialism has greatly advanced us, but it cannot take us any further. We are missing a great deal of reality.</p>
<p>We are doing science wrong. Science should advance faster than one funeral at a time. Funding should be more random.</p>
<p>Why do we strive to study things as far as the moon, if we have never even studied things as near as our own minds?</p>
<p>Esoteric and exoteric science should be merged into a more complete science.</p>
<p><em>Practice</em> is important. Avoid getting so immersed in trying to read all esoteric literatures that you forget to practice anything. Choose one that <em>resonates</em> with you, and practice it. For me, it's scientific esotericism.</p>
<p>We have misunderstood death. We should call death &quot;shedding&quot; instead.</p>
<p>Death is not the end. Dead people simply <em>shed</em> their bodies. They still exist, but our limited senses hamper communication.</p>

<p>Interesting: Google search result for &quot;discarnate scientist&quot; and &quot;discarnate scientists&quot; (both with quotes, for exact match).</p>
<p>We have found that the afterlife exists. Now it is time to find out how to communicate with discarnate beings more efficiently.</p>
<p>Channelers can cooperate with people (spirits) in the afterlife for scientific research.</p>
<p><em>We can ask discarnate beings to do some experiments and report the results to us.</em> Is it linguistically correct to say that a discarnate being is the <em>living remnant</em> of a dead people?</p>
<p>If life does not require a body, what is life?</p>
<p>But first we have to know how to communicate with discarnate beings.</p>
<p>Perhaps &quot;death&quot; should be redefined to &quot;disembodiment&quot;. Instead of saying &quot;he died&quot;, we say &quot;he shed his body&quot;.</p>

<p>If you read a lot, you will not be enlightened; you will only be an expert at speaking like an enlightened person. The text is to guide a <em>practice</em>, not to be read, not to be intellectualized. The language is a limitation; language cannot transmit experience.</p>
<p>I fell to the trap of intellectualizing enlightenment; I tried to understand it, that is to create a mental model of it, not to know it, that is to directly experience it. I was just feeding my monkey mind with words. That realization enlightened me about enlightenment, but it did not enlighten me.</p>
<p>To learn to emote without language, watch silent movies. But aren't body languages language?</p>
<p>To enlighten is to shine light upon, to dispel darkness, to dispel ignorance, to make someone see. To be enlightened is to know. To know what? Everything.</p>

<h3 id="idea-measuring-the-depth-of-meditation"><span class="section_number">2.5</span><span class="section_title">Idea: Measuring the depth of meditation</span></h3>
<p>The depth of meditation can be subjectively measured by the <em>rate of internal distraction</em> (number of internal distractions per unit time). For example, a newbie meditator may be distracted 20 times per minute, and an expert meditator may be distracted 1 time per 15 minutes. One internal distraction is one time realizing that one has been distracted. External distraction does not always translate to internal distraction. For example, when someone talks to me while I am reading an article, I may fail to respond to the other person.</p>
<p>The depth of meditation can be objectively measured by frequency analysis of brain waves?</p>
<h3 id="urge-surfing"><span class="section_number">2.6</span><span class="section_title">Urge surfing</span></h3>
<p>I got this via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-OomGSciTY">Nir Eyal on Video Advice</a>, but you should not watch that information-sparse clickbait-titled overlong video; you should read <a href="https://med.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/documents/Urge-Surfing.pdf">Dartmouth–Hitchcock 3-page document</a> instead.</p>
<p>It's interesting, although nothing new to Buddhists, because urge surfing is a special case of mindfulness.</p>

<p>esoteric science? occult experiments? <a href="http://www.kheper.net/essays/Esoteric_Science.html">http://www.kheper.net/essays/Esoteric_Science.html</a></p>
<p>Should all scientists meditate, so that they directly know?</p>
<p>Desda Zuckerman published her 2012 book &quot;Your Sacred Anatomy: An Owner's Guide To The Human Energy Structure&quot;. Is &quot;spiritual anatomy&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> a theory of psychic functioning? It looks scientific: she did some tests, standardizations, and replications. It started from her observations.</p>
<p>Its thickness is quite intimidating; it took her decades to write, but I think it can be slimmed down, or perhaps split into a few books, each with narrower focus.</p>
<p>She uses the scientific method: observe, hypothesize, experiment. But the subject is her inner experience; how do we directly experience the inner experience of others?</p>

<p>If Consciousness = ability to know (introspectability?) then Subconsciousness = <em>reduced</em> ability to know, and Unconsciousness = inability to know, lack of ability to know.</p>
<p>Cognition and recognition</p>
<p>cogito comes from from con- (from cum-, with) and agito (agere, to do) &lt;2019-11-05&gt; <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogito#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogito#Latin</a></p>
<p>Cognizance, cogitate</p>
<p>Cogito = I think</p>
<p>X recognizes Y iff X cognizes that X cognizes Y.</p>
<p>For example, we see a photo of a distant acquaintance that we last met 40 years ago. We immediately <em>cognize</em> this person, in the sense that we immediately feel that we know this person (we have seen this person somewhere before); but for a moment we strive to think who this person is and where we met this person: it takes us some time to <em>recognize</em> this person.</p>

<h3 id="some-physics-questions"><span class="section_number">7.1</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Some physics questions</span></h3>
<p>If matter is congealed energy, and a wave is a disturbance that moves energy without moving matter, then what?</p>
<p>Let not-you be everything else in the Universe except you.</p>
<p>Moving yourself with velocity v is the same as moving not-you by -v. That is, our ability to move ourselves is the same ability to move the entire Universe. Your gaining kinetic energy mv2 is equivalent to not-you gaining kinetic energy Mv2 where m is your mass and M is the mass of not-you.</p>
<p>But why, accelerating you by a is not the same as accelerating not-you by -a? That is, we can tell who is accelerating by finding out who feels a force.</p>
<p>We cannot tell who is moving, but we can tell who is accelerating. Why is that?</p>
<p>That is, I know a way to move all stars in the sky, but I know no way to move only some stars without moving everything else.</p>
<p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.</p>
<p>Accelerometer measures force, not acceleration.</p>
<p>Or should we redefine acceleration as whatever measured by an accelerometer?</p>
<h3 id="comparing-classical-mechanics-and-quantum-mechanics"><span class="section_number">7.2</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Comparing classical mechanics and quantum mechanics</span></h3>
<p>In Newton-style mechanics, an n-body system is modeled as (x1,ldots,xn) where xk R to R3. The interpretation is &quot;At time t, body 1 is at x1(t) and … and body n is at xn(t)&quot;</p>
<p>In Schrödinger-style mechanics, an n-body system is modeled as psi(x1,ldots,xn) where xk in R3. The interpretation is &quot;At time t, there is a probability density of sqr abs psi(x1,ldots,xn,t) that body 1 is at x1 and … and body n is at xn&quot;</p>

<h3 id="is-motion-continuous"><span class="section_number">7.3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Is motion continuous?</span></h3>
<p>A <em>movement</em> is a change in position.</p>
<p>A <em>motion</em> is a <em>continuous</em> movement (a continuous change in position). But is it appropriate to model continuous movement with continuous functions (continuous in the sense of real analysis)? Is spacetime infinitely divisible?</p>
<p>Classical mechanics makes the ontological commitment that spacetime is infinitely divisible.</p>
<p>A simplifying assumption may be an ontological commitment.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics has more ontological parsimony than classical mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="on-unifying-quantum-mechanics-and-relativity-and-linguistic-issues"><span class="section_number">7.4</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; On unifying quantum mechanics and relativity, and linguistic issues</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps the key to unifying quantum mechanics and relativity is to determine a more correct concept of spacetime.</p>
<p>The key issue is language: the same word &quot;time&quot; is used to mean different things in those theories.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics still assumes Newtonian absolute spacetime. Relativity assumes locality but experiments show that reality is non-local. Perhaps we must relax both of those assumptions. We need a theory that explains both quantum entanglement and spacetime curvature.</p>
<p>We know that something is in the past because we remember it or because we believe someone else who remembers it. But our memory of the past is not what the past actually is.</p>
<p>The way we use a word implies our mental model of its meaning.</p>
<p>How we use a word implies what we think of it.</p>
<p>The usage of a word implies its meaning (how we interpret the word, how we ascribe meaning to the word).</p>
<p>The meaning of a word is determined by the circumstances in which it is used, not by the word itself.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-epistemology-and-ontology-of-spacetime"><span class="section_number">7.5</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; On the epistemology and ontology of spacetime</span></h3>
<p>What does our usage of English imply about how we think of spacetime?</p>
<p>We say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time passes, time flies</li>
<li>The first time, the second time</li>
<li>One time, two times</li>
<li>What time is it</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several meanings.</p>
<p>Space is the separation between matter, and time is the separation between events?</p>
<p>Which one is right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matter occupies space (space contains matter)</li>
<li>Space separates matter</li>
<li>Neither of them</li>
</ul>
<p>Space is the ability to contain, and time is the ability to endure?</p>
<p>What does it mean to bend spacetime? How do we know?</p>
<p>It seems that our minds expect the entropy of the system it observes to always increase.</p>
<p>A gas expands to fill its container. The arrow of time is the direction of time in which the gas seems to expand. The arrow of time is the direction in which entropy increases.</p>
<p>We seem to perceive time to be moving in one direction. Why is that?</p>
<p>We know the speed of the passage of time by looking at the rate of change of things around us.</p>
<p>We define space by the size of an object? The amount of space occupied by an object</p>
<p>But what is time itself?</p>
<h3 id="electromagnetic-wave"><span class="section_number">7.6</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-08-14&gt; Electromagnetic wave</span></h3>
<p>In Maxwell's theory, an electric charge instantaneously affects all of space, and an electromagnetic wave is not something emitted by an electric charge.</p>

But there are lots of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/1401938906/?filterByStar=critical&amp;pageNumber=1">damning reviews</a>, so I did not read the book.</p>

<ul>
<li>To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).</li>
<li><p>Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.</p>
<ul>
<li>People filter incoming information.</li>
<li>People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.</li>
<li>Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.</li>
<li>Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.</li>
<li>Information disagreeing with preexisting belief is filtered out and doesn't depolarize the believer.</li>

<li>This has a concrete recommendations for countering the firehose of falsehood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trump and Putin use &quot;firehose of falsehood&quot; to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.</li>
<li>The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them. Media should stop giving them a platform. We should refuse to hear them. We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power. We should simply dismiss everything they say. Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.</li>
<li>I'm sure Trump and Putin are not the only people using that technique. I suspect that PKS may be using that technique in mosques in West Java.</li>

<ol>
<li><p>What is a friend?</p>
<p>Your friends are those who sacrifice for you. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the friendship. How do we measure a sacrifice?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we measure friendship?</p>
<p>In theory, we define <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> (the <em>friendship measure from A to B</em>) as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.</p>
<p>(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)</p>
<p>Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.</p>
<p>How do we measure friendship in practice?</p>
<p>Foot-in-the-door: let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Door-in-the-face: let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses, and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Those results may differ, but <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> should lie somewhere between those two points. We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum, use interval arithmetics, or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties of friendship</p>
<p>Friendship is circumstantial: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> changes over time.</p>
<p>Friendship is usually asymmetric: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions</p>
<p>What is self-friendship? What is <span class="math inline">\(F(A,A)\)</span>? How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself? Does this question even make sense?</p></li>

<h4 id="defining-boss"><span class="section_number">12.9.2</span><span class="section_title">Defining &quot;boss&quot;</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>What is a boss?</p>
<ol>
<li>X is a <em>boss</em> of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.</li>
<li>X is a <em>strong boss</em> of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.</li>
<li>X is a <em>weak boss</em> of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.</li>
<li>Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.</li>
<li>Don't bite the hand that feeds you.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Another definition, based on fear: X is a boss of Y if Y fears X.</p></li>

<h4 id="happiness"><span class="section_number">12.9.3</span><span class="section_title">Happiness</span></h4>
<p>Happiness = Reality - Expectation.</p>
<p>To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.</p>
<p>Pain also reduces happiness.</p>
<p>Money cannot buy happiness, but it can buys things that will make you happier.</p>
<p>Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable, adding money doesn't add happiness.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-17&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>appeal-to-evolution</em> is this argument: <em>If a trait would hamper the survival of a species, then that species would not have evolved that trait.</em></p>
<p>It is a heuristic. It is not always correct. For example, it cannot explain peacock tails. However, it seems reasonable in absence of other information.</p>
<p>The appeal-to-evolution weakens the theory that irregular eating causes gastritis as follows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very early hunter-gatherer humans ate irregularly; they were always a few days away from starvation, they did not have a secure food supply, they depend very much on their surroundings. <em>Having gastritis due to irregular eating would hamper their survival.</em> Therefore they probably evolved such that irregular eating does not cause gastritis.</p>

<p>Conservation of mass.</p>
<p>Body mass is gained by food and drinks, and lost by exhalation and excretion.</p>
<p>The question is the <em>composition</em> of those mass.</p>
<p>If I weigh 70 kg and both my legs weigh 20 kg, then a squat consumes at least 50 kg * 10 m/s2 * 0.5 m = 200 J = 0.0478 kcal. That's a tiny amount relative to the calories in the food we eat! We can easily eat 300 kcal in one meal. Thus, if the human body were 100% efficient, I would have to squat <em>6,276 times</em> to burn that one meal!</p>
<p>Thus the biggest energy consumer is the basal metabolic processes.</p>
<p>The proximal cause is the combination of nutrition and hormones. Hormones are affected by nutrition, activity, and genetics.</p>
<h4 id="a-clean-eating-protocol"><span class="section_number">12.11.7</span><span class="section_title">A clean eating protocol</span></h4>
<p>Combine <em>nutrition science</em> and <em>psychology</em>.</p>
<p>For two weeks.</p>
<p>Pay attention to gut microbiome.</p>
<p>No sugar; no condiments bought from supermarket because they all have sugar. No flour. No carb. No food that is processed more than one step from its original form. No refined foods. No extracts. Sugar is not OK because it is concentrated sugarcane plant extract. Cooked meat is very OK, but sausage is not. White rice is not OK. Green vegetables OK.</p>
<p>Anytime you're hungry, just eat; there is no time restriction; the only restriction is that you eat real fat/protein.</p>
<p>Everytime you eat, you must send a photograph of what you eat to me. It is not for approval, but for commentary, and for <em>psychology</em>, for accountability, so that you feel that you are doing it for me, so that you don't prematurely abandon your effort.</p>
<p>You can drink anything as long it has no sugar in it. Just drink plain water. Drinks from the supermarket are not OK; they all have sugar.</p>

<h3 id="on-procrastination"><span class="section_number">13.1</span><span class="section_title">On procrastination</span></h3>
<p>I had a habit of delaying important-but-unpleasant things. I had a habit of avoiding them, running away from them. I had an escapism problem.</p>
<p>A concrete example: I got a new phone, but I was too lazy to port my old SIM card due to different form factors; so I got a family member's unused SIM card. Thus I used my old phone much less frequently. Then I forget to pay the phone company which then killed my old number. I had to tell my contacts that I changed my phone number. I had to go to the bank to update my account. Much hassle.</p>
<p>Some delayed problems begat bigger problems. I never thought about that.</p>
<p>I hated the phone company, so I blamed the phone company.</p>
<p>I hated going to the bank.</p>
<p>But then I thought, perhaps it was the Universe's way of telling me that that habit was bad for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could meditate while waiting at the bank.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a good chance to learn equanimity.</p>
<p>The same habit also causes my browser to have hundreds of open tabs. I thought that a link was pointing to an interesting document, so I clicked on it. But I thought that it was unpleasant to actually read the document. I liked imagination and hated reality; I liked to imagine myself understanding the document, but I hated to actually read it.</p>
<p>I know another friend of mine who has the same problem of too many open tabs.</p>
<p>My life would be much easier if I killed the problem while it was small.</p>
