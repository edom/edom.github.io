<p>&lt;2019-11-27&gt;</p>
<p>&quot;In sum, the study found, power doesn’t corrupt; it heightens pre-existing ethical tendencies.&quot; <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-power-corrupts-37165345/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-power-corrupts-37165345/</a></p>

<p>&lt;2019-11-28&gt;</p>
<p>Some people have been suggesting that we operant-condition the politicians. I think that's a brilliant idea. The premise is: somehow politics make people childish, so we apply child psychology to make politicians behave. We praise them whenever they say the truth, and we ignore them whenever they lie.</p>
<p>Perhaps politicians are even simpler than children; perhaps they are like animals, like dogs, which is why operant conditioning works on them.</p>
<p>If politicans are childish, then the people have to be the parents; otherwise the country is all whim.</p>

<h3 id="dissenting-opinions"><span class="section_number">3.1</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Dissenting opinions</span></h3>
<p>Wicker 2017<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> argues that ethical consumerism is not enough to save the world.</p>
<p>If everyone know what truly matters for them, we won't have an environmental crisis.</p>
<p>Not only do you need to pick what you consume, you need to consume less.</p>
<p>Either we change the system, or we use mindfulness to immunize the people against the broken system.</p>
<p>Ethical consumption is not enough; we need everyone to live mindfully; we need a global spiritual revolution.</p>
<h3 id="the-immorality-of-companies-reflects-the-immorality-of-consumers"><span class="section_number">3.2</span><span class="section_title">The immorality of companies reflects the immorality of consumers</span></h3>
<p>Consumers are the masters of companies, because companies need money from consumers to live. Consumers are even more powerful than shareholders, because shareholders get their money from consumers too.</p>
<p>For example, Amazon's mission is &quot;to be Earth's most customer-centric company&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. If consumers want cheap things fast, then so be it, workers be damned.</p>
<p>Profit is a feedback signal that indicates that the company is doing what consumers want. Thus, if we buy from Amazon because it is cheaper, we are voting for getting workers to do maximum work with minimum pay; otherwise our things wouldn't be as cheap and fast as they are today.</p>
<p>If consumers want food to be delivered to their houses, then so be it, environment be damned.</p>
<p>If consumers want new stuff every year, then so be it, environment be damned.</p>
<p>Companies are not the only ones to blame; all of us are to blame for having endless desires.</p>
<p>Everytime we buy something, we make a moral judgement, even if we don't realize it.</p>
<p>Companies are simply doing what the consumers want. If the consumers want cheap things, then so be it, workers and environment be damned. Thus, the immorality of companies reflects the immorality of consumers.</p>
<p>We often buy something without caring about how it is made. We turn a blind eye to the immorality of producing that thing.</p>
<p>The consumer's beliefs determine the company's behavior.</p>
<p>Buying from immoral companies means <em>voting for immoral behavior</em>.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-care"><span class="section_number">3.3</span><span class="section_title">How can we care?</span></h3>
<p>It seems impractical for one person to check every building, every mine, and every employee of all companies.</p>
<p>We establish an organization that summarizes the immorality of companies so concisely that consumers can easily act on that report. We must establish a moral police for policing the morality of companies.</p>
<p>Consumers must unite, prefer, and demand moral companies.</p>
<p>In 2019, I define the adjective &quot;moral&quot; to mean &quot;not detrimental to the survival of the human race&quot; (my moral system in 2019 is natural morality), but you can define &quot;moral&quot; to mean anything that suits your moral system. For example, if you follow Jesus, then you may define &quot;moral&quot; to mean &quot;that would not be disapproved by Jesus&quot;.</p>
<p>To survive, we have to both think and feel.</p>
<p>To change the world, we must first change ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-we-need-something-that-is-produced-by-only-one-company"><span class="section_number">3.4</span><span class="section_title">What if we need something that is produced by only one company?</span></h3>
<p>How are foods going to be delivered to our houses if not with plastic packaging? The only alternative is to move the people instead of moving the food, but aren't we all too lazy to walk to the restaurant?</p>
<p>How are we going to get electricity?</p>
<p>What if we need something that is produced by a monopoly with high barrier to entry?</p>
<p>Boycott the company, and put our lifestyle down a notch?</p>
<p>We can always choose to not buy (and perhaps suffer or die).</p>
<p>We can always kill ourselves, although we usually won't.</p>
<p>The crisis is a question to us: Which do we prefer: much convenience but much environmental destruction, or some inconvenience but slight environmental destruction?</p>

<p>Pengguna narkoba harusnya ditolong, bukan dipenjara.</p>
<p>Korban memakai narkoba karena terisolasi secara sosial (merasa kesepian).</p>
<p>Penjara tidak menyelesaikan apapun.</p>
<p>Penjara adalah masalah, bukan solusi.</p>

<p>Avoid angering the majority.</p>
<p>If the majority are idiots, it is even more important to avoid angering them.</p>
<p>Even if you know the truth, avoid angering the majority.</p>
<p>(Isn't this common sense?)</p>
<h2 id="unfortunately-auto-segregation-is-rational"><span class="section_number">7</span><span class="section_title">Unfortunately auto-segregation is rational</span></h2>
<p>Every man thinks that it's much easier to move to where the &quot;smart&quot; people are than to fix the &quot;idiots&quot; around him.</p>
<p>For example, non-Muslim people would not want to live near mosques because mosques are noisy, but Muslims would want to live near mosques because they go there very often. Thus, those two groups have just automatically segregated themselves without anyone's help.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-15&gt;</p>
<p>In 2019, anyone who thinks that guns can protect them from tyrannical governments is deluded. Governments have better guns, soldiers, cops, bombs, planes, drones, tanks, nukes, and a monopoly on violence bigger than ever in history. Nevertheless, guns can be used to terrorize government employees to discourage people from working for the government,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but I don't recommend that, and I don't plan to discuss asymmetric warfare<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and militant anarchism here.</p>
<p>Thus the only reason left for gun rights is to let people sell guns for profit.</p>

<p>Changing constitutions is almost as hard as changing bibles. Constitutions have become holy books, and political ideologies have become religions. Blind beliefs are bad for progress.</p>
<p>Constitutions should be hard to change, because it is the foundation of all other laws in a country. A constitution that changes often will confuse everyone. Unfortunately, this also means that a bad constitution will stay bad forever.</p>

<h3 id="is-freedom-of-speech-important"><span class="section_number">8.10</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-07-06&gt; Is freedom of speech important?</span></h3>
<p>Examples of degrees of freedom of speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>In USA and Canada, you can talk shit about the government, as long as you don't make death threats, or the cops will get you.</li>
<li>In Indonesia, you can disagree with the government, but you have to do it very politely, or you will be jailed.</li>
<li>In China, if you disagree with the government, your will be encumbered, if not killed.</li>
<li>In Saudi Arabia, if you disagree with the government, you will be killed.</li>
</ul>
<p>But all government is more similar than different: There is always centralization of power, and therefore abuse of power.</p>
<p>Without freedom of speech, life goes on pretty much normally in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the USA, for all its free speech, still has problems like crony capitalism and highest gun-related murder which is totally preventable as shown by the Australians.</p>
<p>Why do you insist on owning a gun? It does not protect you from a tyrannical government. They have bombs, armies, nukes, soldiers, cops, gunboats, aircrafts, hackers, money, what else. If you think your teeny-pistol militia can beat them, you're as deluded as Don Quixote; but actually he has better chances than you do, because windmills don't fight back, whereas governments do. The freedom to bear arms is just a ceremonial distraction from more important issues such as imperialism, privacy, and borders.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-costly-cost-cutting-when-management-overrides-engineers"><span class="section_number">8.17</span><span class="section_title">Examples of costly cost-cutting when management overrides engineers</span></h3>
<p>I used to argue for nuclear fission power. Now I argue against nuclear fission power, not because it is harmful, but because companies cannot be trusted. I feel that companies are inherently incompatible with humanity; they centralize power to shareholders.</p>
<p>I trust engineers and scientists, but I don't trust companies. If a nuclear power plant is run by a company, it is just a matter of time before someone in management cuts costs for short-term profit, skimps on something, dismisses the engineers, and causes an accident. It has happened with airplanes (such as Boeing 737 MAX, they cut corners because they were competing with Airbus), nuclear fission power plants (such as TEPCO Fukushima, they ignored an engineer's concern about the backup pump's vulnerability to giant tsunami).</p>
<p>When you ignore an engineer, a disaster will happen, and you will bear a much higher cost than what would cost you if you just did what the engineer told you to do. Disrespecting engineers and scientists is disrespecting Nature, and <em>Nature does not care about your profits.</em></p>

<p>I hope FairTube wins, but the root cause of the problem is that today's &quot;advertising&quot; is about <em>making people buy</em>, by psychological manipulation, by all means, at all costs; whereas the original 15th century meaning of &quot;to advertise&quot; is to &quot;give notice to others&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. There was no sense of persuasion in the 15th-century advertising.</p>
<p>In 2019, &quot;advertising&quot; is about manipulating people into buying things, by all means not forbidden by law. Thus what we call &quot;advertising&quot; now, we should call &quot;for-profit psychological manipulation&quot;.</p>

<p>We should think of <em>taxes</em> as a way for <em>incentivizing</em> behaviors, <em>not</em> for <em>funding</em> government programs. The government can just create money out of nothing, as long as the money creation rate does not exceed the real economic growth rate. Indeed, right now, banks are creating money out of nothing, in the form of loans, and these virtual numbers can have real effects on prices: If, at the same time, one million people get loans and buy cars, then there will be a short-term shortage of cars (demand surge), and producers may decide to increase production or raise prices or both if the surge persists.</p>
<p>But what if the real economy is shrinking?</p>

<p>When a surgeon fails, he injures one people. When a car driver fails, he injures ten people. When a lawmaker fails, he injures millions of people. Then why do we insist on lower standards for our lawmakers than for our surgeons? Why do we elect clueless clowns and self-enriching thiefs into the government? <em>Because we pay for a surgery but not for an election</em>. Paying for something increases our expectation. We don't pay for an election, so we expect nothing.</p>
<p>But companies do pay for elections, through contributions and lobbyings. Thus companies expect to gain from elections, while people don't.</p>

<p><em>But only Hitler lost the war.</em></p>
<p>Thus now Hitler is condemned, whereas the others are venerated.</p>
<p>It is a crime to murder one person. It is not a crime to wage an unjust war <em>and win the war</em> because the winner gets to define what &quot;crime&quot; is, and then he gets to write the history. This is just human nature. Even I myself suffer from that: I often find myself imagining the killing of billions of people, be it by my own hands or by a natural catastrophe, and I imagine the peace that follows, the problems that disappear, the overcrowding gone, the pollution gone, the noise-makers gone, the exorbitant land prices fall.</p>
<p>There is no government for countries, and thus countries go to war against other countries. At the level of citizens, there is a rule of law, but at the level of countries, it is anarchy. Thus it seems that there has to be a government for governments, but this suffers from infinite regress: second-level governments may go to war with each other, and so on. Thus, the only way to global peace is <em>to have exactly one government for all people</em>, one World Government, because it is impossible to have a war if there is nobody else to wage a war against, that is, if you are the only government in the world. This is the only way to prevent wars.</p>
<p>This World Government should be filled with scientists and engineers because they do politics better than politicians do; see China<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, but it's changing in 2017.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>But people are too chauvinistic, too egoistic, and too proud for a World Government. All nationalism is chauvinism, because we are all citizens of the Earth. As technology is heading toward a singularity, human culture is also heading toward a singularity.</p>
<p>Having different governments also enables tax avoidance, money laundering, and wage slavery, by enabling one to arbitrage different regulations in different countries.</p>

<p>Civil law is always late, because we suck at foretelling. In civil law, everything is legal until legislators make a law against it.</p>
<p>But common law requires higher standards for judges, whereas judges are fallible humans too, just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Humans are not computers. Humans excel at following the <em>spirit</em> of the law. Computers excel at following the <em>letter</em> of the law. Indeed humans who strictly follow the letter of the law may be malicious.</p>
<p>Lawmakers should make principles, not rules. Lawmakers should explicitly state the spirit and intention of the law, not just the letter of the law.</p>
<h3 id="growing-food-is-the-best-solution-to-poverty"><span class="section_number">9.5</span><span class="section_title">Growing food is the best solution to poverty</span></h3>
<p>Growing food is the only sane way to lift many people out of poverty, because <em>Nature pays everyone who works</em>.</p>
<p>It reduces unemployment, poverty, homelessness, crime.</p>
<p>Example<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>A scalable solution to poverty?</p>
<ol>
<li>Relocate poor people to fertile land that is unused but not too far from civilization; give each family 100 square meters.</li>
<li>Help them grow food; educate and train them. Pay attention to ecology, and close the nutrient cycle.</li>
<li>Help them sell their production.</li>
</ol>
<p>This simultaneously solves hunger, poverty, homelessness, overcrowding, and crime.</p>
<p>This reduces agricultural failure risk: More small farms distributed geographically means we have more backups to a regional catastrophe.</p>

<h2 id="capitalism-exploits-individual-selfishness-to-benefit-everyone"><span class="section_number">10</span><span class="section_title">Capitalism exploits individual selfishness to benefit everyone?</span></h2>
<p>Capitalism assumes that humans are bad and selfish. Communism assumes that humans are good and altruistic. In reality, most humans are between those two extremes.</p>
<p>In capitalism, X helps Y because X wants Y's money. Capitalism assumes that there is only unconditional selfishness and no unconditional love. Capitalism is about making the desire to gain money coincide with the desire to better humankind.</p>
<p>In communism, X helps Y because X has unconditional love for everything.</p>
<p>There are no pure capitalism and no pure communism. Humans are somewhere between totally selfish and totally altruistic.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to maximize their own profit. Everyone only cares about themselves. Therefore, a system must be created, such that selfish people can only profit by benefiting others.</p>

<p>A perverse situation may arise, in which the individual is praised for success, but the group is blamed for faults, perhaps due to our desire to feel good and avoid conflicts. An example of such perverse situation is the belief &quot;If this country advances, it's due to the president; if this country regresses, it's due to the government&quot;, or &quot;If this company profits, it's due to the director; if the company loses, it's due to everyone&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="core-beliefs"><span class="section_number">14</span><span class="section_title">Core beliefs</span></h2>
<p>If a belief conflicts with reality, then the belief must change.</p>
<p>We define &quot;good&quot; as &quot;promoting the survival of the human species&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Nationalism is collective egoism.</em> There should be only one government on Earth, and it should be The Only World Government, because otherwise governments will fight each other due to national egoism.</p>
<p>We prefer to be <em>sober</em> and savor every moment of our lives. The only time we use consciousness-altering drugs is in great pain, such as in surgeries or in terminal illnesses. We do not drink alcohol to the point of intoxication.</p>
<p><em>We hate smoke</em>: cigarettes, vapes, you name it, we hate it. We do not smoke.</p>
<p><em>We hate perfumes.</em> We prefer no odor at all. We prefer slight natural body odor to perfumes.</p>
<p>We think a little dandruff and a little body odor is normal.</p>
<p>We treat most bacteria as essential, not as things to be eradicated. We only use antibiotics if it is the only way to save us from death.</p>
<p>We do not want to change the status quo for the sake of change without reason. Disruption is not something to be proud of. Every change has unintended consequences.</p>
<p>We prefer <em>sustainability</em> to growth.</p>
<p><em>Leisure</em> is noble and there is nothing shameful about wanting leisure, seeking sustainability, and shunning gratuitous growth.</p>
<p><em>Pension is robbing the young to pay the old.</em> It assumes that the population pyramid will always have a certain shape. It is not sustainable.</p>

<p>Everything is trading: Buy low, sell high.</p>
<p>Hiring is trading too. Buy labor cheap, sell products high.</p>
<p>Labor has maintenance costs, just like machines. Skimp on machine maintenance, they break down. Skimp on labor maintenance, they resign, or worse, they riot, or even worse, they unionize.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://evonomics.com/role-of-morality-in-a-capitalist-economy/">https://evonomics.com/role-of-morality-in-a-capitalist-economy/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, what do you mean social good? In economics and evolution we have a well-defined concept of public goods. Production of public goods is individually costly, while benefits are shared among all. I think you see where I am going. As we all know, selfish agents will never cooperate to produce costly public goods. I think this mathematical result should have the status of “the fundamental theorem of social sciences.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="seek-wealth-not-money"><span class="section_number">17</span><span class="section_title">Seek wealth, not money</span></h2>
<p>If one wants to be rich, then one should seek wealth, not money. One should always know that money is only a proxy of wealth, and the conversion of money to wealth always depends on who is willing to accept that money.</p>
<h2 id="anarchy-selfishness-institutions"><span class="section_number">18</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-10-28&gt; Anarchy, selfishness, institutions</span></h2>
<p>Humanity should not try anarchy before humanity can overcome its own selfishness.</p>
<p>Anarchy cannot work with selfish people.</p>
<p>Capitalism is the system for making selfish people help others.</p>
<p>Capitalism assumes the least of humans. Capitalism does not assume that people are good.</p>
<p>If humans were not selfish, anarchy would work much better than capitalism did.</p>
<p>Often we do not have the luxury of assuming that people are good.</p>
<p>But the total wealth in the 21st century is much higher than the total wealth in the 20th century.</p>
<p><em>Can humanity accomplish great things without institutions?</em></p>
<p>Even without formal institutions, there will be de-facto makeshift institutions headed by experts who know what to do, established by people who have power.</p>
<p>Institution is one way of doing something that takes more than the lifespan of one human.</p>
<p>Institutions suck, but perhaps they are better than the natural state of man that is anarchy, but anarchy would be the best if humans were able to overcome their selfishness. Anarchy would only work if most people were very altruistic.</p>

<p>These are the possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>The oppressed thinks that they are already dead (their lives are worse than death) anyway, musters enough strength, revolts, and overthrows the government. The non-oppressed (the middle-class) takes collateral damage.</li>
<li>The government kills off all oppressed people. The non-oppressed people lives in their bubble happily ever after.</li>
<li>The government slowly releases control while trying to save face.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xi Jinping cannot release control in 2018, because if he releases control, his opponents will pounce on him, reveal all his crimes, and tarnish his name. Xi Jinping wants to die in good standing, with good reputation; he wants to be remembered as a good person.</p>
<p>I hope that the next bloodshed gives the Chinese people enough reason to limit government power.</p>
<p>You can live a good comfortable life in China as long as you blind yourself from the truth.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can't say the truth there.</li>
<li>There is someone whom people are too afraid to disagree with, even politely.</li>

<p>We must respect the truth. The truth doesn't care about us. People who ignore the truth do so at their own peril. Ignoring the truth means ignoring some danger; such ignorance reduces the chance of survival.</p>

<p>Could the Lenovo SuperFish<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> scandal be accidental? It could be the case that Lenovo was just bundling/preinstalling third-party apps (which seems to be a common practice among OEMs) and did not know that SuperFish installed a certificate.</p>

<p>How the Internet went wrong in 15 steps <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html">http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Step 1: Start With Hippie Good Intentions&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Step 4: […] we paid a high price for keeping [the Internet] free&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;To avoid charging for the internet — while becoming fabulously rich at the same time — Silicon Valley turned to digital advertising.&quot;</li>
<li>Click maximization breeds sensationalism and extremism: <em>anything goes</em>, for a click.
<ul>
<li>Growth at all costs. Growth for the sake of growth. Idolization of growth. Growth is overrated. Growth isn't always desirable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tristan Harris: &quot;We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high. It is literally destroying our society, because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws. Cambridge Analytica is the easiest way of explaining why that’s true. Because that wasn’t an abuse by a bad actor — that was the inherent platform. The problem with Facebook is Facebook.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Step 5: Everything was designed to be really, really addictive. The social-media giants became 'attention merchants', bent on hooking users no matter the consequences. 'Engagement' was the euphemism for the metric, but in practice it evolved into an unprecedented machine for behavior modification.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Guillaume Chaslot: &quot;The way AI is designed will have a huge impact on the type of content you see. For instance, if the AI favors engagement, like on Facebook and YouTube, it will incentivize divisive content, because divisive content is very efficient to keep people online.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Internet business model that is not advertising
<ul>
<li>&quot;Step 12: To fix it, we’ll need a new business model. Maybe […] like charging users for goods and services&quot;</li>
<li>I think Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/YouTube can make country-level subscription that countries pay using taxpayer money.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Step 14: Maybe nothing will change.&quot;</li>
<li>What people say
<ul>
<li>Tim Berners-Lee: &quot;The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.&quot;</li>
<li>Tim Cook: &quot;I don’t have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won’t allow; I don’t want them on a social network.&quot;</li>
<li>Chamath Palihapitiya: &quot;The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. This is not about Russians’ ads. This is a global problem.&quot;</li>

<p>Causal chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boeing 737 MAX crashes two times in less than a year.
<ul>
<li>MCAS (Manuvering Characteristic Augmentation System) fights the pilot.
<ul>
<li>MCAS is a software workaround for a hardware flaw (the aircraft's tendency to pitch up and stall when engine power is increased).
<ul>
<li>The hardware flaw is an economic workaround for a strategic flaw?
<ul>
<li>Boeing wants to avoid retraining costs.</li>
<li>Boeing sticked to the 737 design for too long?

                    I used Disqus, but I removed it because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
                    and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
