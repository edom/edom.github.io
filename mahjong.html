    <p>The variant discussed here is classic Chinese mahjong.</p>

<h1 id="basic-facts">Basic facts</h1>

<p>There are 136 mahjong tiles,
of which 52 are dealed to the players.
The remaining 84 forms the wall.
Thus, in a play, you only get at most 21 chances to change your hand,
that is 84 divided by 4 (the number of players).</p>

<p>If each player takes 15 seconds, then a hand
will take at most 4 x 15 x 21 = 1,260 seconds (21 minutes).</p>

<p>There are 136 tiles (not including 4 flower tiles and 4 season tiles):</p>

<p>There are 3 suits (bams, dots, and chars). Each suit has 9 classes. Each number has 4 instances. Thus each suit has 36 tiles. Thus there are 108 suit tiles.</p>

<p>There are 7 honors (4 winds and 3 dragons). Each honor has 4 instances. Thus there are 28 honor tiles.</p>

<p>There are 27 suit classes and 7 honor classes, giving a total of 34 classes.</p>

<p>Each tile class has 4 instances.</p>

<p>Each tile is equally probable to be drawn.</p>

<p>The probability of picking a tile class is 4/136. The odds of picking a tile class is 4:132.</p>

<h1 id="number-of-chows-pungs-and-kongs">Number of chows, pungs, and kongs</h1>

<p>The probability of drawing a pung:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 = 1/3,015 (odd of 1 : 3,014, approx 1 : 3,000)</p>

<p>Each suit has 7 unique chows: 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789.
There are 3 suits, so there are 21 unique chows.
Each tile has 4 instances.
Each chow has 4^3 instances.
The probability of drawing a chow: 21 * 4^3 / (136 * 135 * 134) = 28 / 51,255
(odd of 1 : 51,227, approx 1 : 51,000).</p>

<p>Pung is more likely than chow. Is this a calculation mistake?</p>

<p>The probability of drawing a kong (four identical tiles):
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = 1/400,995 (odd of 1 : 400,994, approx 1 : 401,000)</p>

<p>The probability of drawing a pair:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 = 1/45 (odd of 1 : 44)</p>

<p>The probability of drawing two tiles having the same class:
4/136 * 3/135 = 1/1,530 (odd of 1 : 1,529)</p>

<p>The probability of drawing two tiles having the same suit (3 suits):
3 * 36/136 * 35/135 = 7/34 (odd of 7 : 27, approx 1 : 4)</p>

<p>The probability of drawing a chow:
The probability of drawing n, n+1, n+2 unordered of the same suit, for n in 1 to 7:</p>

<p>3! * 3 * 7 * 4/136 * 4/135 * 4/134 = 56/17,085 (odd of 56 : 17,029, about 1 : 304)</p>

<p>The probability of drawing a pair, given that one tile has been drawn by another player:</p>

<p>Let each player draw exactly one tile. The probability of four players drawing the same tile:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = the probability of drawing a kong</p>
