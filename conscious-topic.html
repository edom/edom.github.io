<p>(On Desda Zuckerman's 2012 book &quot;Your Sacred Anatomy: An Owner's Guide To The Human Energy Structure&quot;.) Is &quot;spiritual anatomy&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> a theory of psychic functioning? It looks scientific: she did some tests, standardizations, and replications. It started from her observations. How good is its explanatory/predictive power? The book is dauntingly thick; perhaps we should watch some videos instead?</p>
<p>Grout 2013 experiments.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I feel that SSRF<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> is a bit off. Despite its name, I don't see any science in its website; no theories, no explanations, no experiments, only instructions and claims. Some people even think that SSRF is brainwashing.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Farsight Institute sometimes makes some big claims<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. I don't know the truth, but those claims are a bit too kooky for my taste.</p>
<p>Horgan 2017<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>And if you really experience nothing, how can you remember the experience? How do you emerge from this state of oblivion back into ordinary consciousness?
</code></pre>
<p>Possibly enlightenment?<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Note that the subjects themselves do not label the experience as &quot;enlightenment&quot;, but apparently all of them at least experience temporary ego death.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagine something so fun that I lost sense of time (1–2 hours had passed, whereas I think it was only 15–30 minutes). Is that ego death? But I don't feel extreme bliss.</p>
<p>Enlightenment?<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>People &quot;who are congenitally blind for organic reasons and have never been able to see anything in their entire lives can perceive the environment when their non-local consciousness detaches from their bodies during various life-threatening situations.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> If blind people can do that, then myopia should be a trivial obstacle. Seeing without eyes is not crazy if you already know remote viewing. Also see Katharina Friedrich's &quot;seeing without eyes&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> (&quot;Sehen ohne Augen&quot;). Are there English videos? What are her experiments and theories?</p>
<p>Remote viewing is similar to automatic writing/drawing in that both of them use the subconscious. How do we distinguish these cases?</p>
<ol>
<li>The viewer's consciousness goes to the target.</li>
<li>The viewer and the target communicate by telepathy.</li>
<li>The viewer reads some Akashic records about the target.</li>
<li>The viewer is let know by a spirit/disembodied consciousness.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the evidence for auras? What does Kirlian photography actually capture? Biofield evidence?<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>What is the evidence for chakras?</p>
<p><em>Why does all psychic development book boil down to deep meditation and visualization</em>? If they work, how do they work?</p>
<p>Are &quot;super psychic kids&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> real?</p>
<p>I am reading David DeBold's &quot;Miracle mastery&quot; book?</p>
<p>What are Paramahansa Yogananda's &quot;scientific techniques for attaining direct personal experience of God&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>?</p>
<p>Is the goal of null-domain meditation (empty-mind meditation) ego death?</p>
<p>Does an enlightened man know that he is enlightened? To be enlightened is to know reality directly without the material senses?</p>
<p>If an enlightened person cannot be disturbed<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, then what is the difference between enlightenment and apathy?</p>
<p>Some of the quickly visible effects of meditation are reduced stress and increased ability to maintain focus.</p>
<p>Is meditation about focus, about relaxation, or about quieting the mind?</p>
<p>Read Quora psychics-related topic, and perhaps Reddit, but Quora is more structured (question-answer).</p>
<p>Is Patanjali<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> right? Did he know what he was talking about?</p>
<p>Does myopia hamper aura-seeing? Do we use eyes to see aura? If not, then myopia should not hamper aura-seeing.</p>
<p>(On telekinesis and the conservation of energy.) Where does the energy come from? Does the practitioner become tired? Is energy conserved?</p>

<p>Perhaps we prayed because it will rain; perhaps the future affects the past.</p>
<p>I declare &lt;2019-11-25&gt; as my day one of consciousness experiments. By then I had been meditating lightly for a few days.</p>
<h2 id="idea-measuring-the-depth-of-meditation"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Idea: Measuring the depth of meditation</span></h2>
<p>The depth of meditation can be subjectively measured by the <em>rate of internal distraction</em> (number of internal distractions per unit time). For example, a newbie meditator may be distracted 20 times per minute, and an expert meditator may be distracted 1 time per 15 minutes. One internal distraction is one time realizing that one has been distracted. External distraction does not always translate to internal distraction. For example, when someone talks to me while I am reading an article, I may fail to respond to the other person.</p>
<p>The depth of meditation can be objectively measured by frequency analysis of brain waves?</p>
<h2 id="calling-all-scientists-and-engineers-with-personal-psychic-experiences"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Calling all scientists and engineers with personal psychic experiences</span></h2>
<p>Who are engineers/scientists who have personal psychic experiences?<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Some of them are Russell Targ (he has witnessed some psychic phenomena; his website<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> has some links<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>) and Alan Hugenot (where did he learn mediumship?).</p>
<p>Among those engineers/scientists, who have theories and experiments?</p>
<p>Gathering the engineers/scientists may speed up the next scientific revolution.</p>
<p>The theory does not have to be stated in terms of mainstream physics. The theory simply has to explain/predict some psychic aspects of reality, and we can marry the theory and mainstream physics later.</p>
<p>Consciousness research is long overdue, but I think it is at least speeding up.</p>
<h2 id="on-funding-psychic-research-and-on-working-around-the-brokenness-of-how-we-do-science"><span class="section_number">4</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; On funding psychic research, and on working around the brokenness of how we do science</span></h2>
<p>While we wait for the old guards to die, we can ask the crowd to fund our psychic/paranormal research. It would be even better if we could force those old guards to retire early as they have become the very thing they sought to destroy in their youth. It seems that the way we do science in the 21st century corrupts open-minded youths into close-minded old guards. There is something wrong with the system. &quot;Publish or perish&quot; make people game citations. Proposals take too much effort to write and, even worse, the grants are awarded to &quot;safe-bet&quot; researches that have slim chance of discovering anything important.</p>
<p>Our way of doing science is systematically broken: old guards have too much power, grants are not allocated to enough varieties, people are too attached to theories, and the majority is too risk-averse. For faster progress, science should be anarchistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; leads to a dead end. Theoretical physicists should also identify and relax the simplifying assumptions, not just tinker with mathematics. Theoretical physics is not a branch of mathematics. Theoretical physics is a combination of philosophy and mathematics.</p>

<p>If matter is congealed energy, and a wave is a disturbance that moves energy without moving matter, then what?</p>
<p>Let not-you be everything else in the Universe except you.</p>
<p>Moving yourself with velocity v is the same as moving not-you by -v. That is, our ability to move ourselves is the same ability to move the entire Universe. Your gaining kinetic energy mv2 is equivalent to not-you gaining kinetic energy Mv2 where m is your mass and M is the mass of not-you.</p>
<p>But why, accelerating you by a is not the same as accelerating not-you by -a? That is, we can tell who is accelerating by finding out who feels a force.</p>
<p>We cannot tell who is moving, but we can tell who is accelerating. Why is that?</p>
<p>That is, I know a way to move all stars in the sky, but I know no way to move only some stars without moving everything else.</p>
<p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.</p>
<p>Accelerometer measures force, not acceleration.</p>
<p>Or should we redefine acceleration as whatever measured by an accelerometer?</p>

<p>In Newton-style mechanics, an n-body system is modeled as (x1,ldots,xn) where xk R to R3. The interpretation is &quot;At time t, body 1 is at x1(t) and … and body n is at xn(t)&quot;</p>
<p>In Schrödinger-style mechanics, an n-body system is modeled as psi(x1,ldots,xn) where xk in R3. The interpretation is &quot;At time t, there is a probability density of sqr abs psi(x1,ldots,xn,t) that body 1 is at x1 and … and body n is at xn&quot;</p>

<h2 id="is-motion-continuous"><span class="section_number">7</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Is motion continuous?</span></h2>
<p>A <em>movement</em> is a change in position.</p>
<p>A <em>motion</em> is a <em>continuous</em> movement (a continuous change in position). But is it appropriate to model continuous movement with continuous functions (continuous in the sense of real analysis)? Is spacetime infinitely divisible?</p>
<p>Classical mechanics makes the ontological commitment that spacetime is infinitely divisible.</p>
<p>A simplifying assumption may be an ontological commitment.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics has more ontological parsimony than classical mechanics.</p>
<h2 id="on-unifying-quantum-mechanics-and-relativity-and-linguistic-issues"><span class="section_number">8</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; On unifying quantum mechanics and relativity, and linguistic issues</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps the key to unifying quantum mechanics and relativity is to determine a more correct concept of spacetime.</p>
<p>The key issue is language: the same word &quot;time&quot; is used to mean different things in those theories.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics still assumes Newtonian absolute spacetime. Relativity assumes locality but experiments show that reality is non-local. Perhaps we must relax both of those assumptions. We need a theory that explains both quantum entanglement and spacetime curvature.</p>
<p>We know that something is in the past because we remember it or because we believe someone else who remembers it. But our memory of the past is not what the past actually is.</p>
<p>The way we use a word implies our mental model of its meaning.</p>
<p>How we use a word implies what we think of it.</p>
<p>The usage of a word implies its meaning (how we interpret the word, how we ascribe meaning to the word).</p>
<p>The meaning of a word is determined by the circumstances in which it is used, not by the word itself.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-epistemology-and-ontology-of-spacetime"><span class="section_number">9</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; On the epistemology and ontology of spacetime</span></h2>
<p>What does our usage of English imply about how we think of spacetime?</p>
<p>We say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time passes, time flies</li>
<li>The first time, the second time</li>
<li>One time, two times</li>
<li>What time is it</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several meanings.</p>
<p>Space is the separation between matter, and time is the separation between events?</p>
<p>Which one is right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matter occupies space (space contains matter)</li>
<li>Space separates matter</li>
<li>Neither of them</li>
</ul>
<p>Space is the ability to contain, and time is the ability to endure?</p>
<p>What does it mean to bend spacetime? How do we know?</p>
<p>It seems that our minds expect the entropy of the system it observes to always increase.</p>
<p>A gas expands to fill its container. The arrow of time is the direction of time in which the gas seems to expand. The arrow of time is the direction in which entropy increases.</p>
<p>We seem to perceive time to be moving in one direction. Why is that?</p>
<p>We know the speed of the passage of time by looking at the rate of change of things around us.</p>
<p>We define space by the size of an object? The amount of space occupied by an object</p>
<p>But what is time itself?</p>

<p>No sugar; no condiments bought from supermarket because they all have sugar. No flour. No carb. No food that is processed more than one step from its original form. No refined foods. No extracts. Sugar is not OK because it is concentrated sugarcane plant extract. Cooked meat is very OK, but sausage is not. White rice is not OK. Green vegetables OK.</p>
<p>Anytime you're hungry, just eat; there is no time restriction; the only restriction is that you eat real fat/protein.</p>
<p>Everytime you eat, you must send a photograph of what you eat to me. It is not for approval, but for commentary, and for <em>psychology</em>, for accountability, so that you feel that you are doing it for me, so that you don't prematurely abandon your effort.</p>

<p>&lt;2019-08-17&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>appeal-to-evolution</em> is this argument: <em>If a trait would hamper the survival of a species, then that species would not have evolved that trait.</em></p>
<p>It is a heuristic. It is not always correct. For example, it cannot explain peacock tails. However, it seems reasonable in absence of other information.</p>
<p>The appeal-to-evolution weakens the theory that irregular eating causes gastritis as follows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the very early hunter-gatherer humans ate irregularly; they were always a few days away from starvation, they did not have a secure food supply, they depend very much on their surroundings. <em>Having gastritis due to irregular eating would hamper their survival.</em> Therefore they probably evolved such that irregular eating does not cause gastritis.</p>

<p>Conservation of mass.</p>
<p>Body mass is gained by food and drinks, and lost by exhalation and excretion.</p>
<p>The question is the <em>composition</em> of those mass.</p>
<p>If I weigh 70 kg and both my legs weigh 20 kg, then a squat consumes at least 50 kg * 10 m/s2 * 0.5 m = 200 J = 0.0478 kcal. That's a tiny amount relative to the calories in the food we eat! We can easily eat 300 kcal in one meal. Thus, if the human body were 100% efficient, I would have to squat <em>6,276 times</em> to burn that one meal!</p>
<p>Thus the biggest energy consumer is the basal metabolic processes.</p>
<p>The proximal cause is the combination of nutrition and hormones. Hormones are affected by nutrition, activity, and genetics.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-friend"><span class="section_number">17.1.1</span><span class="section_title">What is a friend?</span></h4>
<p>Your friends are those who sacrifice for you. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the friendship. How do we measure a sacrifice?</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-measure-friendship"><span class="section_number">17.1.2</span><span class="section_title">How do we measure friendship?</span></h4>
<p>In theory, we define <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> (the <em>friendship measure from A to B</em>) as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.</p>
<p>(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)</p>
<p>Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.</p>
<p>How do we measure friendship in practice?</p>
<p>Foot-in-the-door: let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Door-in-the-face: let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses, and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts. Then we have found <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Those results may differ, but <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> should lie somewhere between those two points. We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum, use interval arithmetics, or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.</p>
<h4 id="properties-of-friendship"><span class="section_number">17.1.3</span><span class="section_title">Properties of friendship</span></h4>
<p>Friendship is circumstantial: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B)\)</span> changes over time.</p>
<p>Friendship is usually asymmetric: <span class="math inline">\(F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="questions"><span class="section_number">17.1.4</span><span class="section_title">Questions</span></h4>
<p>What is self-friendship? What is <span class="math inline">\(F(A,A)\)</span>? How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself? Does this question even make sense?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is a boss?</p>
<ol>
<li>X is a <em>boss</em> of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.</li>
<li>X is a <em>strong boss</em> of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.</li>
<li>X is a <em>weak boss</em> of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.</li>
<li>Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.</li>
<li>Don't bite the hand that feeds you.</li>

<p>Happiness = Reality - Expectation.</p>
<p>To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.</p>
<p>Pain also reduces happiness.</p>
<p>Money cannot buy happiness, but it can buys things that will make you happier.</p>
<p>Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable, adding money doesn't add happiness.</p>

<ul>
<li>To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).</li>
<li><p>Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.</p>
<ul>
<li>People filter incoming information.</li>
<li>People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.</li>
<li>Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.</li>
<li>Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.</li>
<li>Information disagreeing with preexisting belief is filtered out and doesn't depolarize the believer.</li>

<li>This has a concrete recommendations for countering the firehose of falsehood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trump and Putin use &quot;firehose of falsehood&quot; to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.</li>
<li>The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them. Media should stop giving them a platform. We should refuse to hear them. We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power. We should simply dismiss everything they say. Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.</li>
<li>I'm sure Trump and Putin are not the only people using that technique. I suspect that PKS may be using that technique in mosques in West Java.</li>

                    I used Disqus, but I removed it because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
                    and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
