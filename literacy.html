<p>Writing and speaking are <em>transmission</em>, the conversion of thought to symbols.</p>
<p>Reading and listening are <em>reception</em>, the conversion of symbols to thought.</p>
<p>To <em>communicate</em>, the transmitter and the receiver must share the necessary <em>background knowledge</em> and <em>language</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>language</em> is a system that relates utterances and meanings.</p>
<p>The <em>background knowledge</em> is a set of beliefs.</p>
<p>A <em>belief</em> is a logical formula with no free variables.</p>

<h3 id="writing-is-harder-than-reading"><span class="section_number">2.1</span><span class="section_title">Writing is harder than reading</span></h3>
<p>Writers write for readers. Readers read for themselves, not for writers. Writers are expected to write from the reader's point of view. Readers are not expected to read from the writer's point of view.</p>
<p>Readers have the money.</p>
<p>Readers expect more from writers than writers expect from readers. The writer is supposed to be the party that spends more effort in the communication.</p>
<p>Writing is harder than reading because writers <em>must</em> think more than readers do. Writers cannot <em>passively</em> write; they must first come up with some <em>thoughts</em> to write before they can write anything at all. Readers can passively read a text and still suboptimally benefit from it.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor to that asymmetry is the physical constraint that eyes can move faster than hands, but perhaps there will be machines to dump our thoughts directly into symbols, or even to directly transmit our thoughts to others, directly between brains, without eyes and hands.</p>
<p>Speaking is harder than listening for the same reason: Speaking requires thought, and listening does not.</p>
<h3 id="writers-have-voice-and-authority"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">Writers have voice and authority</span></h3>
<p>It is easy to copy the writing many times, and it is hard to change all copies of the writing.</p>

<p>Writers try to convince readers, even in narratives.</p>

<p>Not only arguments, but also narratives, must be convincing.</p>
<p>Psychology.</p>
<p>Avoid triggering the reader's <em>defense mechanism</em>.</p>
<h2 id="not-writers-block-but-thinkers-block"><span class="section_number">4</span><span class="section_title">Not writer's block, but thinker's block</span></h2>
<p>This is the basic writing method:</p>
<ol>
<li>A thought appears in one's mind.</li>
<li>He writes that down.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is not about finding what to write, but finding what to <em>think</em>. A writer's block is actually a <em>thinker's block</em>. It is not about running out of words. It is about running out of <em>thoughts</em>.</p>
<p>Writing begins with <em>thoughts</em>, not words. Writing is converting thoughts to text. If one has no thoughts, he has nothing to convert to text.</p>
<h2 id="iteration"><span class="section_number">5</span><span class="section_title">Iteration</span></h2>
<p>Writers rewrite many times. Readers reread many times.</p>

<p>Technical books always face a certain dilemma: whether to cater to <em>top-down</em> or to <em>bottom-up</em> learners. A top-down learner prefers to read or skim documentation, getting a large overview of how the system works; only then does she actually start using the software. A bottom-up learner is a &quot;learn by doing&quot; person—someone who just wants to dive into the software and figure it out as she goes, referring to book sections when necessary.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-important-to-motivate-the-reader"><span class="section_number">8.5</span><span class="section_title">It is important to motivate the reader</span></h3>
<p>It is counter-productive to begin a mathematical text with a definition. Such text should begin with <em>motivation</em>.</p>
<p>It is counter-productive to begin a textbook in group theory by listing the group axioms. We are creative humans, not mechanical theorem provers.</p>
<p>Such textbook should begin with <em>why</em> the reader should care about group theory. At least, it should begin with why the writer thinks that group theory is fascinating. But it's difficult: How do we convince someone that something as abstract as group theory is interesting?</p>
<p>Don't make the readers think; make them <em>see</em>. Your goal as a writer is to be a giant who enables the readers to stand on your shoulder as fast as possible, so that they can see farther into the unexplored knowable world.</p>

            and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
