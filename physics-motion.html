<p>We can model a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body">rigid body</a> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle">point mass</a>, that is, as if all the mass of that body is concentrated at one geometrical zero-dimensional point that occupies no space at all. This mathematical fiction is philosophically unsound, but works well as long as the body does not disintegrate.</p>
<p>For example, in most situations, we only care about where a car is; we don't care where the wheels are, where the wipers are, etc. We just assume that the car is one point.</p>
<h3 id="digression-what-is-position"><span class="section_number">1.2</span><span class="section_title">Digression: What is position?</span></h3>

<h3 id="digression-on-galileo"><span class="section_number">2.1</span><span class="section_title">Digression: On Galileo</span></h3>
<p>Galileo was an enemy of unjustified beliefs.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It must have been lonely to be the only thinking person among mindless people.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_New_Sciences">Galileo 1638</a> studied falling objects, among other things. We now concisely write his discovery as a quadratic equation that relates the height of fall and the time of fall, but he did not have that luxury. He only had numbers and Euclidean geometry. Analytic geometry had not been widespread.</p>
<h3 id="digression-measuring-force-with-a-spring"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">Digression: Measuring force with a spring</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke's law</a> enables us to use springs to measure forces. First, we calibrate the spring by measuring its stiffness <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> using a standard weight (such as a kilogram or a liter of water). Then, the magnitude of the pulling force <span class="math inline">\(F = k \cdot x\)</span> is calculated from the observed elongation <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Other names for this tool are &quot;spring scale&quot;, &quot;force gauge&quot;, &quot;force meter&quot;, &quot;dynamometer&quot;. See <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Silom%C4%9Br_25.png?">picture</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-free-falls-with-numbers"><span class="section_number">2.3</span><span class="section_title">Modeling free falls with numbers</span></h3>
<p>Galileo (or was it someone else?) dropped two heavy solid things with different masses from the same height, and he found that both of them reached the ground at the same time, regardless of the height from which they fell.</p>
<p>Galileo found a quadratic relationship <span class="math inline">\( h = k t^2 \)</span> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\( h \)</span> is the <em>height of fall</em>: the height from which an object is dropped, as measured from the ground below it.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\( t \)</span> is the <em>time of fall</em>: the time the object takes to reach the ground from its height of fall.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\( k \)</span> is a constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Did Galileo found that or <span class="math inline">\( h = k \cdot \sin \theta \cdot t^2 \)</span>? Inclined planes?)</p>
<p>(Digression about history: Was this due to <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/c7gqnpNf">Galileo</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation#Early_history">Grimaldi and Riccioli</a>?)</p>
<h3 id="finding-power-laws-with-logarithms"><span class="section_number">2.4</span><span class="section_title">Finding power laws with logarithms</span></h3>
<p>I suspect that this method was probably used, in the 16th century, by Galileo to find the relationship between height of fall and time of fall, and by Kepler to formulate some of his laws of planetary motion, and by many others.</p>
<p>Suppose that we suspect that the quantity <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the quantity <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> have the relationship <span class="math inline">\( y = mx^p \)</span>, and we want to find out <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>First we use logarithms to turn the equation into a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\( \log m \)</span> and <span class="math inline">\( p \)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
y &amp;= mx^p
\\ \log y &amp;= \log(mx^p)
\\ \log y &amp;= \log m + p \log x
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>Then we make <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> measurements, we plot the graph, we see if we can fit a straight line to the points, and calculate the slope.</p>
<p>If we want to be more modern, we can use the method of least squares.</p>

<p>The vector AB is the shortest path from point A (its origin) to point B (its destination). Thus a vector has magnitude and direction.</p>
<p>A vector is usually drawn as a straight line with an arrowhead on its destination end.</p>
<p>In everyday situation, the shortest path connecting two points is a straight line. However, in a long-haul flight, the shortest path is an arc, unless we drill through the Earth.</p>
<p>A coordinate is a tuple (a bunch, a group) of numbers.</p>
<p>The question &quot;Where is something?&quot; can be answered systematically, such as with postal addresses.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is that point P?&quot; The Cartesian coordinate system answers &quot;P is at <span class="math inline">\((1,2)\)</span>&quot; to mean &quot;from the point A, go 1 step east, then go 2 steps north, and then you will be at P&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-free-falls-with-vectors"><span class="section_number">3.2</span><span class="section_title">Modeling free falls with vectors</span></h3>
<p>Newton found that an apple and the moon are falling toward the Earth in the same way. But why stop at apples and moons? Surely <em>everything</em> is falling towards each other?</p>
<p>Newton's key insight is that everything falls in the <em>same manner</em> (due to the <em>same cause</em> that is named &quot;gravity&quot;): Both an apple and the moon are falling towards the Earth <em>in the same manner</em>. Falling and orbiting are the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball">Newton's cannonball</a> for a picture.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_{ik}\)</span> be the relative position of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> <em>as seen by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></em>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(x_{ik} = x_i - x_k\)</span>.</p>

<p>Here is the only thing you need to remember in order to understand the indexes: The <em>last letter</em> of the pair (e.g. the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(ik\)</span>) denotes the <em>point of view</em>. The order of the indexes <span class="math inline">\(ik\)</span> (that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> comes before <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) was chosen to match the order of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (that <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> comes before <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) in the English phrases &quot;relative position of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> <em>as seen by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></em>&quot; and &quot;force due to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> <em>as felt by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></em>&quot;.</p>
<p>The law of universal gravitation is <span class="math inline">\( F_{ik} = - G m_i m_k x_{ik} / \norm{x_{ik}}^3 \)</span>.</p>
<p>If we only care about the magnitude: <span class="math inline">\( F = G m_1 m_2 / r^2 \)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the distance between two objects.</p>
<p>If there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bodies, then the resultant force on body <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the sum of each force exerted on body <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by each other body <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.

<p>Newton used the third law to derive the law of conservation of momentum;[33] from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via Noether's theorem from Galilean invariance), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when force fields as well as particles carry momentum, and in quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The conservation of momentum can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Conservation">derived</a> from Newton's third law of motion.</p>

<p>Imagine a pendulum.</p>
<p>A pendulum has a fixture, a rope, and a bob.</p>
<p>Simulate its natural motion in your imagination. Now freeze the simulation time. We will analyze the forces acting on the pendulum at that point in time.</p>
<p>Let the positive x-axis point rightward.</p>
<p>Let the positive y-axis point away from the ground.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the length of the rope.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\( (0,0) \)</span> be the xy-coordinates of the bob when the line is orthogonal to the ground.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\( \theta \)</span> be the angle of the rope, where zero means that the rope is orthogonal to the ground, and positive means counterclockwise.</p>
<p>With the help of an imaginary line that is orthogonal to the rope and that intersects the bob, we see that two forces are acting on the bob: the bob weight whose xy-coordinates are <span class="math inline">\( (0,-mg) \)</span> and the rope tension whose xy-coordinates are <span class="math inline">\( (-mg \sin \theta, mg \cos \theta) \)</span>.</p>
<p>But that complication arose because we were using a Cartesian coordinate system. If we let <span class="math inline">\( \theta \)</span> be the coordinate of the bob, only one force is acting on the bob: the bob weight whose <span class="math inline">\( \theta \)</span>-coordinate is <span class="math inline">\( - mg \sin \theta \)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>-coordinate of the rope tension is always <span class="math inline">\( 0 \)</span>.</p>
<p>Both the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>-coordinate <span class="math inline">\( \theta \)</span> and the xy-coordinates <span class="math inline">\( (L \sin \theta, L \cos \theta) \)</span> <em>refer to the same point in space</em>.</p>
<p>How do we generalize this?</p>
<h3 id="modeling-motion-with-other-coordinate-systems"><span class="section_number">4.2</span><span class="section_title">Modeling motion with other coordinate systems</span></h3>
<p>A <em>coordinate system</em> <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> maps each coordinate tuple to a point.</p>
<p>A <em>coordinate system transformation <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span></em> maps each <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E(x) = F(T(x))\)</span>.</p>
<p>A coordinate tuple can be thought of a name of a point. Renaming the point does not change the point.</p>
<p>In the pendulum example in the previous section, the coordinate system transformation from <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>-coordinate-system to <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-coordinate-system is <span class="math inline">\( T(\theta) = (L \sin \theta, L \cos \theta) = (x,y) \)</span>.</p>
<p>Is it always possible to transform the coordinate system in order to &quot;cancel out&quot; a force?</p>
<p>Lagrangian mechanics can be seen as the application of coordinate transformation to Newtonian mechanics? Deeper than that?</p>
<p>A coordinate system does not have to be linear.</p>
<p>The first magical step in Lagrangian mechanics is to pick a coordinate system that fits the possible trajectory of the object. This is to zero out the constraint forces.</p>
<p>… such that the number of parameters matches the degree of freedom …</p>
<p>For example, the pendulum has one degree of freedom, but we superfluously used two parameters …</p>

<p>Not only do we want to model <em>movement</em>; we also want to model <em>motion</em>.</p>
<p>What is the difference between &quot;movement&quot; and &quot;motion&quot;?</p>
<p>In short, a <em>movement</em> is a change in position, and a <em>motion</em> is a continuous movement.</p>
<p>Both movement and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_%28physics%29">motion</a> mean a change of position, but there is a subtle difference. When we say &quot;movement&quot;, we care only about whether an object has changed its position. When we say &quot;motion&quot;, we care about the trajectory, the details, how the object changed its position over time.</p>
<p>What is change? Change is inequality, non-identity, non-sameness. Change happens over <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>How do we know that an object moved? By observing a change in its position. A thing <em>moves</em> iff its position changes. Its <em>position</em> is where it is in space.</p>
<p><em>Displacement</em> is relative position.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-velocity-with-derivatives"><span class="section_number">5.2</span><span class="section_title">Modeling velocity with derivatives</span></h3>
<p>We can <em>derive</em> the velocity function <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> from the trajectory <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, with differential calculus.</p>
<p>If we record that a body was at position <span class="math inline">\(x(t_0)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and that it was at position <span class="math inline">\(x(t_1)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, then we say that the body moved between time <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> with the <em>average velocity</em> <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v}(t_0,t_1) = \frac{x(t_1)-x(t_0)}{t_1-t_0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we endeavor to record the movement more frequently that <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, we approximate the <em>instantaneous velocity</em> of the body at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\( v(t_0) = \lim_{t_1 \to t_0} v(t_0,t_1) = \lim_{t_1 \to t_0} \frac{x(t_1) - x(t_0)}{t_1 - t_0} \)</span>.</p>
<p>We define &quot;the <em>derivative</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>&quot; as <span class="math inline">\( [Df](x) \)</span> where:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
[Df](x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>Note that here <span class="math inline">\(Df\)</span> notates a function, read &quot;derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>&quot;, not &quot;<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\([Df](x)\)</span> notates the output produced by function <span class="math inline">\(Df\)</span> for input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some derivatives can easily be computed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative#Rules_of_computation">many shortcuts</a> found by our ancestors.</p>
<p>Exercise: If <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span>, evaluate <span class="math inline">\([Df](5)\)</span>, using the power rule.</p>

<p>Consider a system of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bodies.</p>
<p>The Newton model of that system is <span class="math inline">\( (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \)</span> where <span class="math inline">\( x_k : \Real \to \Real^3 \)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. The interpretation is &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, body <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is at <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t)\)</span>, …, and body <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is at <span class="math inline">\( x_n(t) \)</span>&quot;. The model is further constrained by a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equations, each of the shape <span class="math inline">\( F_k = m \cdot \ddot{x}_k(t) \)</span>, where the shape of <span class="math inline">\(F_k\)</span> depends on the details of the physical system that is being modeled. For example, if body <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> experiences friction, then <span class="math inline">\(F_k\)</span> may depend on <span class="math inline">\(\dot{x}_k\)</span>. Another example: if all bodies are celestial bodies, then <span class="math inline">\( F_k(t) = \sum_{i \neq k} \frac{G \cdot m_k \cdot m_i}{\norm{x_i(t) - x_k(t)}^2} \)</span>, from Newton's law of universal gravitation.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F_k\)</span> may involve the time parameter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the position <span class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span>, its derivatives, and its retardations such as <span class="math inline">\(x_k(t-1)\)</span>, etc., but only a tiny subset of those expressions have solutions that can be computed manually.</p>
<p>Why stop at the first derivative?</p>
<p>Inertia of an object preserves the object's motion.</p>
<p>Force acting on an object changes the object's motion.</p>
<p>Hooke's law: Hang a spring of length <span class="math inline">\( L \)</span>. Attach a unit of weight <span class="math inline">\( w \)</span>, to the free end of the spring, and the length of the spring changes to <span class="math inline">\( L + x \)</span>. Attach another unit of weight, and the length of the spring changes to <span class="math inline">\( L + 2 x \)</span>.</p>
<p>Attaching a weight of <span class="math inline">\( n w \)</span> to the free end elongates the spring by <span class="math inline">\( n k x \)</span> from its resting length.</p>
<p>If an object changes its motion, then the resultant force acting on that object is nonzero.</p>
<p>We know forces only by their effects. We don't know forces.</p>
<p>It is very intuitive to posit that all objects would rather rest than move, as Aristotle posited.</p>
<p>But we can directly feel forces by the tension in our muscles? Thus we can know forces?</p>
<p><em>Dynamic friction</em> is modeled as the force <span class="math inline">\( F = - k \vec{v} \)</span>.</p>
<p>??? The position of a body at a given time is represented by a vector in the observer's vector space.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-the-cause-of-motion"><span class="section_number">5.4</span><span class="section_title">Modeling the cause of motion</span></h3>
<p>A force is defined as the cause of motion.</p>
<p>If we observe that an object is accelerating, then we take it to mean that a non-zero resultant force is acting on the object.</p>
<p>Newton's second law: Iff <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is the sum of all forces acting on an object at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and iff <span class="math inline">\( p(t) \)</span> is the object's momentum at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\( F = Dp \)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-an-object-as-a-gravitational-field"><span class="section_number">5.5</span><span class="section_title">Modeling an object as a gravitational field</span></h3>
<p>A <em>time-invariant gravitational field</em> <span class="math inline">\( g \)</span> is a function such that a point mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> at position <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would feel a gravitational force of <span class="math inline">\( F = m \cdot g(x) \)</span>.</p>
<p>Digression: Philosophy (is this correct?). By modeling an object as a gravitational field, we sidestep an ontological question (about what the object is), and deal with an epistemological question (how do we know the object, that is by its effects).

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu(T_k)\)</span> be the length of the time interval <span class="math inline">\(T_k\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\mu([a,b]) = b-a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\( s_k = v_k \cdot \mu(T_k) \)</span> …</p>

<p>Consider this scenario. An apple of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is free falling. At first it is at height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and it has velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. After some time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has elapsed, it is at height <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> and its velocity is <span class="math inline">\(v&#39;\)</span>. Positive <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> points away from the ground. Positive <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> points away from the ground.</p>
<p>Use Galileo's observation (motion with constant acceleration) to relate those variables:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
v&#39; &amp;= v + gt
\\ h&#39; &amp;= h + vt + gt^2/2
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>Rearrange the equations:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(v&#39;)^2 &amp;= v^2 + 2vgt + (gt)^2
\\ h&#39; - h &amp;= vt + gt^2/2

<p>???</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

\\ g \cdot (h&#39; - h) &amp;= gvt + g^2t^2/2

<p>Finally:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
g \cdot dh &amp;= \frac{1}{2} d(v^2)
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>???</p>
<p>By the conservation of energy, <span class="math inline">\( K(t) + T(t) = E \)</span> where <span class="math inline">\( E \)</span> is a constant, for all <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\( 1/2 \cdot m \cdot [v(t)]^2 + m \cdot g \cdot h(t) = E \)</span></p>
<p>However, if we model the system state as <span class="math inline">\( (h,v) \)</span>, we get the equation <span class="math inline">\( 1/2 \cdot m \cdot v^2 + m \cdot g \cdot h = E \)</span>, which can be rearranged to state <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.

<p>In this model, time is no longer a parameter; time is now modeled as an axis of a four-dimensional mathematical space that we call &quot;spacetime&quot;. One may <em>imagine</em> that the positive x-, y-, z-, and t-axis of spacetime point <em>rightward</em>, <em>forward</em>, <em>upward</em>, and <em>futureward</em>, respectively. However, <em>do not visualize a four-dimensional space</em>; use algebra instead. If we have to visualize spacetime, we usually visualize a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram">spacetime diagram</a>&quot; instead, a two-dimensional projection of spacetime, in which we pick only the x-axis and the t-axis.</p>
<p>(Digression: In what sense is futureward orthogonal to rightward? How do we measure the angle between the x-axis and the t-axis? With what tool? A protractor?)</p>
<h3 id="modeling-an-object-as-a-curve-in-spacetime"><span class="section_number">7.2</span><span class="section_title">Modeling an object as a curve in spacetime</span></h3>
<p>An object is modeled by a <em>curve</em> <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in spacetime.</p>
<p>A curve is a set of points.</p>
<p>This curve is also called the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">world line</a>&quot; of the object.</p>
<p>The interpretation of a point <span class="math inline">\((x,y,z,t) \in C\)</span> is &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the object is at <span class="math inline">\((x,y,z)\)</span>&quot;. This is the same interpretation as that of the previous models; we are just using a different mathematical technology/formalism/sublanguage.</p>
<p>Not only does that curve represent the object's motion, but that curve also represents the continued <em>existence</em> of an object.</p>
<p>We assume that the object exists for eternity. We assume that the curve is infinite.</p>
<p>Given a curve that represents an object, how do we compute the object's velocity?</p>
<p>If the curve is <span class="math inline">\( \SetBuilder{(x(\tau),y(\tau),z(\tau),t(\tau))}{\tau \in \Real} \)</span>, then the velocity function <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> can be computed as <span class="math display">\[ v(\tau) = ([Dx](\tau), [Dy](\tau), [Dz](\tau), [Dt](\tau)) \]</span></p>
<p>Repeating <span class="math inline">\((\tau)\)</span> feels clunky, so we generalize function application to also work on tuples: If <span class="math inline">\(f,g,h,i\)</span> are functions, then we write <span class="math inline">\((f,g,h,i)(x)\)</span> to mean <span class="math inline">\((f(x),g(x),h(x),i(x))\)</span>. Thus we can now write: <span class="math display">\[ v = (Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt) \]</span></p>

<p>We may imagine that an <em>observer</em> carries these things around:</p>
<ul>
<li>a point in him that he calls his &quot;origin&quot;;</li>
<li>a clock, for measuring his time;</li>
<li>three rulers, for locating points in his space;</li>
<li>three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">accelerometers</a>, for measuring his acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<p>From his point of view, his origin is always stationary.</p>
<p>(We're jumping the gun here?) It is simple to <em>practically synchronize</em> two clocks: you just bring them together, start them together, and see any discrepancies in their measurements. If you transport one of them <em>relatively slowly</em>, they should still be <em>mostly synchronized</em> when the other one arrives at its destination.</p>
<p>(Digression: Can a crude accelerometer be made from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level">spirit level</a>?)</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\( v_{ab} \)</span> be the velocity of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> <em>as seen by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> sees <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> moving with velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_{ba}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must see <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> moving with velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_{ab} = -v_{ba}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ v_{ba} = -v_{ab} \]</span></p>
<p>This is easy to test: we can find two people X and Y, ask X to stand still, and ask Y to walk with velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> toward X. Then Y can easily imagine that X is moving toward him with velocity <span class="math inline">\(-v\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is strange that velocity is relative but acceleration is not relative.</p>
<p>We know that we are accelerating iff we feel a force that acts uniformly on all parts of us.</p>
<p>Let not-you be everything else in the Universe except you.</p>
<p>Moving yourself with velocity v is the same as moving not-you by -v. That is, our ability to move ourselves is the same ability to move the entire Universe. Your gaining kinetic energy mv2 is equivalent to not-you gaining kinetic energy Mv2 where m is your mass and M is the mass of not-you.</p>
<p>But why, accelerating you by a is not the same as accelerating not-you by -a? That is, we can tell who is accelerating by finding out who feels a force.</p>
<p>We cannot tell who is moving, but we can tell who is accelerating. Why is that?</p>
<p>That is, I know a way to move all stars in the sky, but I know no way to move only some stars without moving everything else.</p>
<p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.</p>
<p>Accelerometer measures force, not acceleration? Or should we redefine acceleration as whatever measured by an accelerometer?</p>

<p>From our point of view, we are always <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>.

<p>Let us compare the models of a <em>system of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rigid bodies</em> throughout history.</p>

<h3 id="motion-its-measurement-by-sampling"><span class="section_number">13.1</span><span class="section_title">Motion: Its measurement by sampling</span></h3>
<p>We can measure the motion of an object by sampling its position at various times.</p>
<p>We may describe a man's motion as &quot;At 4am he was on his bed. At 9am he was at his office. At 7pm he was at his home.&quot;</p>
<p>We may describe a star's motion as &quot;In May it was 50 degrees upward from my house entrance. In June it was 40 degrees upward from my house entrance.&quot;</p>
<p>We can observe the motion of a tennis ball as follows. We get a stopwatch, a pen, and a sheet of paper. Then we make an observation sample by simultaneously recording where the tennis ball is and what time the stopwatch is showing. Then we repeat that sampling. Then we have an observation.</p>
<h3 id="speedvelocity-their-measurement"><span class="section_number">13.2</span><span class="section_title">Speed/velocity: Their measurement</span></h3>
<p>Speed: How do we measure it?</p>
<p>The <em>speed</em> of an object is how fast it moves: how far it moves in how much time. <em>Fast</em> means high speed, going far in little time, traveling much distance in little time.</p>
<p><em>Average speed</em> is distance traveled divided by time required.</p>
<p>Velocity: How do we measure it?</p>
<p><em>Velocity</em> is the rate of change of position. Speed is the magnitude of velocity. <em>Rate of change</em> is defined by <em>derivative</em>.</p>
<p>We measure velocity of an object indirectly, by comparing the object's position at various times.</p>
<h3 id="motion-described-with-functions"><span class="section_number">13.3</span><span class="section_title">Motion, described with functions</span></h3>
<p>A <em>real function</em> can summarize the sampling of the motion of an object. The function extrapolates the table of observations. It is straightforward to see and test the correspondence between the mathematical description and the described reality: We just check whether the function approximates the values in the table of observation. The function is much more compact but has slightly more errors than the table. A good model sacrifices a little correctness to gain a lot of simplicity.</p>
<p>But then there was relativity. Now we have to model the other observer's time.</p>
<p>But then there was quantum mechanics. Now we cannot model position as a real function.</p>
<p>We can make a table of observations relating the time of observation and the position of an object at that time.</p>
<p>Force is what we feel when a spring resists our pull. With mathematics, we can give meaning to phrases like &quot;twice the force&quot;.</p>
<p>Real functions are not the only way to model motions.</p>
<h3 id="motion-described-with-ordered-sets"><span class="section_number">13.4</span><span class="section_title">Motion, described with ordered sets</span></h3>
<p>We can model motion as a set of positions and an order. We can write A &lt; B &lt; C to mean that the particle was at A before it was at B, and it was at B before it was at C.</p>

<h4 id="describing-motion"><span class="section_number">13.4.1</span><span class="section_title">Describing motion</span></h4>
<p>A description of a thing's motion answers the question &quot;Where is that thing when?&quot; Such description relates position and time.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Function relating time and displacement</p>
<p>We can think of a thing's displacement at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as a mathematical <em>function</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> is the thing's displacement at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Note that the function is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, not <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>An example of an equation of motion is <span class="math inline">\(x(t) = 2 \hat{e} t\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{e}\)</span> is a unit vector. It describes an object that moves with constant velocity <span class="math inline">\(2 \hat{e}\)</span> (constant speed 2 towards constant direction <span class="math inline">\(\hat{e}\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Equation of motion</p>
<p>An <em>equation of motion</em> is an equation that describes the motion of an object by relating time and displacement.</p>
<p>Each equation of motion corresponds to a moving thing. If we want to describe <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> moving things, we make <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equations of motion.</p>
<p>An example of <em>implicit</em> equation is <span class="math inline">\(x(t) = - (d(d(x)))(t)\)</span>. This is also an example of a <em>differential equation</em> because it contains the derivative operator <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Basis???</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> be a linear basis. Suppose that the displacement of an object at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(x(t) = e(x_1(t), \ldots, x_n(t))\)</span>. Then the velocity at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(v(t) = \der(x,t) = e(v_1(t), \ldots, v_n(t))\)</span>. Can we say that <span class="math inline">\(v_k(t) = \der(x_k,t)\)</span>?</p>
<p>Moral of the story: If we have a linear basis, then doing calculus on the coordinates is doing calculus on the vectors.</p></li>

<p>Reverse dynamics: Motion causes force?</p>

<p>Given the force acting on an object, we can compute the object's motion.</p>
<p>Given the object's motion, we can compute the force acting on the object.</p>
<p>Centrifugal force is an example of force that is caused by a change in the object's motion? If we are driving a car and we turn the steering wheel to the left, we feel a force pushing us to the right.</p>
<h3 id="can-we-directly-observe-force"><span class="section_number">14.2</span><span class="section_title">Can we directly observe force?</span></h3>
<p>We can feel if we are falling or if we are standing tilted.</p>
<p>Even when we are measuring a force with a dynamometer, we are really observing the position of the dynamometer needle, not the force itself. We never see forces in the way we see colors. We only assume the existence of forces, and we assume that force is the direct cause of motion.</p>
<p>A thing changes its motion because there are forces acting on it.</p>
<p>By saying &quot;force is the cause of motion&quot;, we have not really explained much; we have merely named the cause.</p>
<p>We can also bypass philosophy, and simply define <em>force</em> to be what a force meter measures. A force meter<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> may be a spring.

<p>It is evident that things weigh. One can verify it by trying to lift them.</p>
<p><em>Weight</em> is what a weight balance measures.</p>
<p>A weight balance has two arms.</p>
<p>Put a weight on an end of a weight balance. Push the other end with your hand until the balance comes to rest. When they reach equilibrium, both of them exerts the same amount of <em>force</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>net force</em> acting on an object is the sum of all other forces acting on that object.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> be the distance between the second end to the fulcrum.</p>

<p>He found that the duration is proportional to the square root of the length of the plane if the inclination angle is held constant. Probably through a table of logarithms, in the same way Kepler calculated the exponents in his laws of planetary motion.</p>

<p>The interpretation is: &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span>, the position of body <span class="math inline">\( k \)</span> is <span class="math inline">\( x_k(t) \)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>For each body <span class="math inline">\( k \)</span>, its trajectory is represented by a function <span class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span> : Time → Position, where time is represented by a real number, and a body's position is represented by a point in a three-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
<p>Iff <span class="math inline">\( x(t) \)</span> is an object's position at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\( p(t) \)</span> is the object's momentum at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and iff the object's mass is constant <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\( p(t) = m \cdot [D x](t) \)</span>, or, <span class="math inline">\( p = m \cdot D x \)</span>, but note that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is a scalar and <span class="math inline">\(Dx\)</span> is a function (which is a vector in a function space, in the generalized mathematical sense), and thus <span class="math inline">\(m \cdot Dx\)</span> can be thought of as &quot;<span class="math inline">\(Dx\)</span> scaled by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\( F_k(t) \)</span> is the sum of forces acting on object <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because acceleration is the second time-derivative of position, we can substitute <span class="math inline">\( a_k = D(Dx_k) \)</span> into <span class="math inline">\( F_k = m_k \cdot a_k \)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\( F_k = m_k \cdot D(Dx_k) \)</span>.</p>
<p>If the bodies are celestial objects, then the shape of <span class="math inline">\( F_k \)</span> is determined by Newton's law of universal gravitation.</p>
<p>Thus, in the Newton model, the entire system of <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> bodies is represented by <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> differential equations, in which each differential equation has the shape <span class="math inline">\( F_k(t) = m_k \cdot [D(Dx)](t) \)</span>, where the expression <span class="math inline">\( F_k \)</span> usually contains <span class="math inline">\( x_k \)</span>.</p>

<p>All the above models of mechanics, both classical and quantum, make tacit assumptions about spacetime (space and time). In particular, they presume that spacetime is absolute and the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Einstein models replaces the assumption of absolute spacetime (shared by all bodies) with relative (body-specific) spacetime.</p>
<p>(Here I am using &quot;body&quot; as a synonym of &quot;observer&quot;.)</p>
<p>In Einstein models, there is no such thing as &quot;the position of body <span class="math inline">\( k \)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span>&quot;; it is replaced with &quot;the position of body <span class="math inline">\( j \)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span> <em>according to body <span class="math inline">\( i \)</span></em>&quot;, that is, <em>both</em> the position and the time are as seen from body <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>

<p>A common problem with <em>all</em> those model is that they tacitly assume that spacetime is infinitely divisible like the set of real numbers.</p>
<p>But what would be the mathematics of non-continuous spaces be like? And what would it imply about the isotropy of space?</p>
<h2 id="is-motion-continuous"><span class="section_number">16</span><span class="section_title">&lt;2019-11-27&gt; Is motion continuous?</span></h2>
<p>A <em>movement</em> is a change in position.</p>
<p>A <em>motion</em> is a <em>continuous</em> movement (a continuous change in position). But is it appropriate to model continuous movement with continuous functions (continuous in the sense of real analysis)? Is spacetime infinitely divisible?</p>
<p>Classical mechanics makes the ontological commitment that spacetime is infinitely divisible.</p>
<p>A simplifying assumption may be an ontological commitment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the key to unifying quantum mechanics and relativity is to determine a more correct concept of spacetime.</p>
<p>The key issue is language: the same word &quot;time&quot; is used to mean different things in those theories.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics still assumes Newtonian absolute spacetime. Relativity assumes locality but experiments show that reality is non-local. Perhaps we must relax both of those assumptions. We need a theory that explains both quantum entanglement and spacetime curvature.</p>
<p>We know that something is in the past because we remember it or because we believe someone else who remembers it. But our memory of the past is not what the past actually is.</p>

<p>What does our usage of English imply about how we think of spacetime?</p>
<p>We say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time passes, time flies</li>
<li>The first time, the second time</li>
<li>One time, two times</li>
<li>What time is it</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several meanings.</p>
<p>Space is the separation between matter, and time is the separation between events?</p>
<p>Which one is right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matter occupies space (space contains matter)</li>
<li>Space separates matter</li>
<li>Neither of them</li>
</ul>
<p>Space is the ability to contain, and time is the ability to endure?</p>
<p>What does it mean to bend spacetime? How do we know?</p>
<p>It seems that our minds expect the entropy of the system it observes to always increase.</p>
<p>A gas expands to fill its container. The arrow of time is the direction of time in which the gas seems to expand. The arrow of time is the direction in which entropy increases.</p>
<p>We seem to perceive time to be moving in one direction. Why is that?</p>
<p>We know the speed of the passage of time by looking at the rate of change of things around us.</p>
<p>We define space by the size of an object? The amount of space occupied by an object</p>

                    I used Disqus, but I removed it because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
                    On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website were broken,
                    and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
