<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-software"><span class="section_number">2.1</span><span class="section_title">What do we mean by &quot;software&quot;?</span></h3>
<p>The word &quot;software&quot; appeared no later than Tukey 1958,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and by it he meant the same thing that most people mean by &quot;software&quot; in 2019, that is, the intangible-but-vital choreography inside computers that makes them useful.</p>
<p>The word &quot;hardware&quot; appeared no later than the 15th century in which it meant &quot;small metal goods&quot;. The phrase &quot;hardware store&quot; appeared no later than 1789.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>What does &quot;software&quot; mean in 2019 English?</p>
<p>The word &quot;software&quot; is a mass noun, which is uncountable. When one write &quot;a software&quot;, one usually means to write &quot;a program&quot; instead.</p>
<p>If we can list something, then it is described by a countable noun. There are abstract countable nouns, such as &quot;invitation&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;, and &quot;achievement&quot;. There are concrete uncountable nouns, such as &quot;water&quot;.</p>
<p>We simply accept this syntactic idiosyncrasy as the cost of using English. This is a trivial syntactic inconvenience. Let us move on to more important semantic issues.</p>
<p>Now we discuss ontology and mereology.</p>
<p>&quot;Software&quot; and &quot;hardware&quot; are <em>disjoint</em> categories: If something is software, it is not hardware; if something is hardware, it is not software.</p>
<p>A computer is the sum of its hardware and its software. A computer consists of hardware, software, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Thus, by &quot;software&quot;, we actually mean &quot;the <em>software part</em> of all computers&quot;. &quot;Software&quot; is like &quot;water&quot;: By saying &quot;water exists&quot;, we actually mean &quot;there exists an object that has the properties of water&quot;.</p>
<p>But software is not purely abstract: It is stored in hardware as an arrangement of materials. But is that software or a <em>representation</em> of software?</p>
<p>What other things can be analyzed as a sum of hardware and software? Laws, choreographies, recipes.</p>
<p>A <em>software house</em> is a company that makes software.</p>
<p>Why &quot;hardware <em>store</em>&quot; but &quot;software <em>house</em>&quot;? A software house is more like a blacksmith's workshop than a hardware store: Things can be <em>made-to-order</em> in a blacksmith's workshop but not in a hardware store. Like &quot;production house&quot; for movies.</p>
<p><em>Hardware bridges software and reality.</em></p>
<p>A piece of hardware is a concrete object that can be controlled by an abstract object (a piece of software).</p>
<p>Software is an arrangement of matter (hardware) that makes the hardware useful. But must software have any purpose?</p>
<p>Examples of programming: Designing mechanical linkages. We arrange matter so that it does something we want.</p>
<h3 id="an-analogy-between-hardware-and-dancers"><span class="section_number">2.2</span><span class="section_title">An analogy between hardware and dancers</span></h3>
<p>Software is to hardware as choreography is to dancers. Indeed choreographies <em>are</em> software. Choreographies without dancers are dead ideas. Dancers without choreographies are useless matter.</p>
<p>The dancers are the hardware, the choreography is the software, and the entire performance is the running computer.</p>
<h3 id="computer-vs-running-computer"><span class="section_number">2.3</span><span class="section_title">Computer vs running computer</span></h3>
<p>A computer has software, but is the computer running?</p>
<h3 id="what"><span class="section_number">2.4</span><span class="section_title">What?</span></h3>
<p>Software is an arrangement of matter (hardware).</p>
<p>Software has existed for millenniums.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Software is executable abstract object?</p>
<p>Software is program, documents, configuration, and so on.</p>
<p>Software is abstract object.</p>
<p>Software is executable mathematics.</p>
<p>Software is an idea.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-software"><span class="section_number">2.5</span><span class="section_title">Examples of software</span></h3>
<p>Programs, laws, choreographies, and recipes are software.</p>
<p>Minds are software?</p>
<h3 id="programs"><span class="section_number">2.6</span><span class="section_title">Programs?</span></h3>
<p>Programs used to mean &quot;public notice&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Authorities wrote programs to inform the public so that people behave accordingly.</p>
<p>What is programming? Programming is forcing. X programs Y to do Z iff X forces Y to do Z.</p>
<p>What can be programmed? People are programmable to some extent. We program people when we ask them to do something. Software development process itself is also programmable to some extent.</p>

<h3 id="engineering-as-applied-science"><span class="section_number">3.1</span><span class="section_title">Engineering as applied science</span></h3>
<p>Engineering is the <em>application</em> of science.</p>
<p>Engineering consists of design, modeling, calculation, application of science, and turning all those plans into reality.</p>
<p>Engineering is tradeoff, compromise, optimization with respect to constraints, such as physical constraints and economic constraints.</p>
<p>Engineering implies design goals, tradeoffs, and decisions.</p>
<p>Engineering does not inherently involve many people. A one-man engineering project is an engineering project. It is the methodology that makes it engineering, not the amount of people involved in it. However, when many people are involved, some methodology has to exist in order to ensure that any progress is even possible at all.</p>
<p>To engineer something is to scientifically force something.</p>
<p>Inability to maintain our past works is a sign of engineering failure. A person is actually three people: his past self, his present self, and his future self.</p>
<p>&quot;Science&quot; simply meant &quot;knowledge&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> What is knowledge? There are at least two theories of knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popper: science is a falsifiable belief. That means, the belief must be such that it is possible to design an experiment that disproves the belief.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li>Plato: knowledge is justified true belief</li>
</ul>
<p>(Do we need to dive into epistemology here?)</p>
<p>What is a scientific theory? A scientific theory is a theory that is falsifiable, has explanatory power, and has predictive power.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-an-engineer-do"><span class="section_number">3.2</span><span class="section_title">What does an engineer do?</span></h3>
<p>A civil engineer plans the materials according to the physical load that the structure is expected to withstand. The software engineer's analog is capacity planning of the computational resources according to the computational load that the software is expected to withstand.</p>

<p>If a branch of engineering is an application of a branch of science, then what branch of science is applied in software engineering? What is software science?</p>
<p>Civil engineering is the application of natural science (especially physics) to build civil structures such as bridges, buildings, dams, roads, and other many things used by civilizations.</p>
<p>A civil engineer can predict how much load a steel beam can handle. Can a software engineer predict how much load a machine can handle?</p>
<p>Software engineering is the application of computer science?</p>

<p>The abstract-object counterpart of concrete-object physics How do we apply the scientific method to the study of abstract objects? To anything?</p>
<p>If engineering is an application of science, what is the science that is applied in software engineering?</p>
<p>We need something like Newton's laws of motions for software dynamics that will enable us to predict things.</p>
<p>What should be the object of study of software science? Software? What is software? A model of reality? A model.</p>
<p>Software dynamics? Science of bottlenecks? Queuing theory.</p>
<p>If computer science is science, where are the falsifiable theories and the experiments?</p>
<p>A software is a model of reality.</p>
<p>Which branch of science studies models?</p>
<p>Which branch of science studies abstract objects? None. All branches so far are materialistic. They study concrete objects.</p>
<p>What experiments can be done with abstract objects? Besides thought experiments?</p>
<p>We can experiment with a program: We can stress-test it to figure out its maximum load (the maximum number of requests it can handle per second without errors), in a similar way we stress-test a steel bar to figure out its maximum load (the maximum force it can withstand without breaking). Benchmark games are similar to tables of material strengths.</p>
<p>We can experiment with abstract objects. For example, we can test software, we can test ideas. The problem is that each piece of software creates its own branch of science that is not transferable to other pieces of software. For example, knowledge of word processors is not applicable to accounting information systems. It is as if there were different Newton's laws of motion for cars, bikes, rocks, and other things. We need a science of all software, not just a particular software.</p>
<p>What does science do with its object of study? Come up with a predictive theory and experiments to falsify it.</p>
<p>Science comes from Latin &quot;scientia&quot; which simply means &quot;knowledge&quot;, but &quot;science&quot; is the application of the scientific method, the formulation of theories with explanatory and predictive power, and the experimentation to falsify such theories.</p>
<p>Before science can even exist, the language must first exist. We must first invent the terms, name the objects, and form the ontology. We must first find out what to talk about. We must first define the object of study.</p>

<h3 id="good-laws-enforceability-and-unintended-consequences"><span class="section_number">4.6</span><span class="section_title">Good laws, enforceability, and unintended consequences</span></h3>
<p>Good laws are:</p>
<ol>
<li>enforceable, and</li>
<li>have minimal unintended consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Human laws are programs executed by humans. The nature of human laws is the same as computer programs, The difference is that humans mostly follow the spirit of the law, and computers always follow the letter of the law.</p>
<p>Example: Banning smoking is not practical to enforce: Are you going to put a cop in each building? Banning prostitution is not enforceable: Are you going to put a cop in each building?</p>
<p>I hypothesize that the principles of good software engineering is applicable to good legal engineering. Lawmakers are legal engineers. They should have engineering background. They engineer the lives of lots of people and the future of nations.</p>
<p>When a surgeon fails, he injures one people. When a car driver fails, he injures ten people. When a lawmaker fails, he injures millions of people. Then why do we insist on lower standards for our lawmakers than for our surgeons? Why do we elect clueless clowns and self-enriching thiefs into the government?</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that &quot;Oh, you're a computer scientist? So you can fix my computer?&quot;</p>
<p>We don't study computers. We study software.</p>
<p>Universities should merge law departments and computer science departments into software departments.</p>

<h3 id="turing"><span class="section_number">5.1</span><span class="section_title">Turing?</span></h3>
<p>Turing's theory is about computation, not software.</p>
<h3 id="software-complexity-theory"><span class="section_number">5.2</span><span class="section_title">Software complexity theory</span></h3>
<p>Essential complexity = Kolmogorov complexity = the length of the shortest description of the software. The description must contain enough information for clean-room-reimplementation by another software engineer without any communication to the requirement analyst.</p>
<p>Accidental complexity = a measure of the apparent size of the software; number of syntax objects (abstract-syntax-tree nodes), number of lines of code.</p>
<h3 id="essential-complexity-theory"><span class="section_number">5.3</span><span class="section_title">Essential complexity theory</span></h3>
<p>Here we are interested in a measure of complexity, the cognitive load of understanding the software?</p>
<p>Kolmogorov complexity.</p>
<p>The complexity of a software system is the length of the shortest description of that system. The description must be such that someone else can recreate the system from only the description.</p>
<p>Example: a formula that describes a program that checks whether a list <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is ordered according to the ordering <span class="math inline">\(\le\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\( \forall i \forall j ( i \le j \implies x_i \le x_j ) \)</span></p>
<p>The formula can then be fed to descriptive complexity theory in order to determine the minimum possible resources required to implement the system. For example, it is a well-known fact in computer science that comparison-sort of an array of <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> elements require <span class="math inline">\( \Omega(n log n) \)</span> time.</p>
<p>If something takes <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span> seconds to finish, then doing it <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> times takes <span class="math inline">\( n \cdot t \)</span> seconds to finish.</p>
<p>That should also work under uncertainty: If something takes <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span> seconds to finish <em>on average</em>, then doing it <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> times takes <span class="math inline">\( n \cdot t \)</span> seconds to finish <em>on average</em>. But telling the whole truth requires knowing the shape of the distribution, not only the mean.</p>
<h3 id="descriptive-complexity-theory"><span class="section_number">5.4</span><span class="section_title">Descriptive complexity theory</span></h3>
<p>Descriptive complexity theory is deep: It puts a lower bound on the solutions of problems regardless of the machines that implement those solutions. It is due to the inherent/essential complexity in logic itself, and not due to accidental complexity of the machine implementation.</p>
<p>In software engineering, the results of computational complexity theory are used for capacity planning, for example, that the lower time bound of comparison sorting is quasilinear<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. This enables us to calculate the number of processors and the amount of memory, from the number of requests we expect to serve.</p>
<p>In reality, what is important is the actual number of seconds that users are willing to wait for computations with expected input sizes.</p>
<h3 id="capacity-planning-theory"><span class="section_number">5.5</span><span class="section_title">Capacity planning theory</span></h3>
<p>The mathematics of basic bottleneck science is simple: It is only basic arithmetics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). If one wants more details, one can resort to queuing theory, but capacity planning can be done with simple basic arithmetics, without the full power of queuing theory<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="programming-science"><span class="section_number">5.6</span><span class="section_title">Programming science</span></h3>
<p>Lambda calculus can be a model of computer programs, but how do we experiment, and what should we falsify?</p>
<h3 id="software-development-science"><span class="section_number">5.7</span><span class="section_title">Software development science</span></h3>
<p>Software engineering is hard because it requires the engineer to estimate estimations.</p>
<p>We often want to estimate how long it takes to implement something.</p>
<p>But the estimation itself can only be done by doing the thing, because software development is full of unforeseeable roadblocks, because that software does not fit in our working memory. (How do we know that a library cannot do something? We have to try and find it out the hard way. Unfortunately that's the only way.)</p>
<p>So we try.</p>
<p>Thus we estimate how long it takes us to come up with a probable estimation.</p>
<p>Thus software engineering is second-order estimation.</p>
<p>Example: To estimate how long it takes to do X:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try doing X for a week.</li>
<li>See how much is actually done.</li>
<li>Extrapolate.</li>
</ul>
<p>This estimation should be much more accurate than pure guessing.</p>
<p>Thus the proper answer to &quot;How long will it take?&quot; is &quot;It will take a week for me to come up with an estimation.&quot;</p>
<p>We estimate that it will take us a week to come up with an estimation.</p>
<p>It's hard to estimate how much time is required to implement something, because we need to estimate how long it takes to estimate.</p>
<p>The only known way to estimate software development time is by extrapolating: Try developing it for a month, measure the accomplishments, and extrapolate from there.</p>
<p>Is it simpler in civil engineering? If you know that laying one brick takes 10 seconds, then you know that laying 1,000 bricks takes 10,000 seconds, but that is an oversimplification: Some civil engineering projects are also late, such as Jakarta mass rapid transport, but is it a political issue or an engineering issue?</p>
<h3 id="specification-theory"><span class="section_number">5.8</span><span class="section_title">Specification theory</span></h3>
<p>A <em>specification</em> is a logical formula in conjunctive normal form with at least one positive clause (literal?).</p>
<h3 id="science-of-models"><span class="section_number">5.9</span><span class="section_title">Science of models</span></h3>
<p>How do we measure a model's quality/fidelity, and with respect to what purpose?</p>
<h3 id="science-of-software-changes"><span class="section_number">5.10</span><span class="section_title">Science of software changes</span></h3>
<p>It is obvious that software has inertia, and bigger software is harder to change.</p>
<p>Suppose that we have a system <span class="math inline">\( S \)</span> that satisfies the logical formula <span class="math inline">\( \phi \)</span>, and we want to change <span class="math inline">\( S \)</span> to <span class="math inline">\( S&#39; \)</span> that satisfies <span class="math inline">\( \phi&#39; \)</span>. How much is the effort? It seems that the effort cannot be deduced from the logical formula alone.</p>
<p>It is possible to make two programs that satisfy the same logical formula (have the same observable behavior) but have widely different source codes.</p>
<h3 id="states"><span class="section_number">5.11</span><span class="section_title">States</span></h3>
<p>All practical systems have memory.</p>
<p>All systems that have memory are stateful.</p>
<p>Thus, we have to learn to live with states.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: Programming language is too free. If programming language is limited (that is, if there is only one way to do one thing), then software will standardize itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>The program may be rewritten, but the functional requirements, the business logic and the mathematical truths rarely change.
<ul>
<li>In order to make software last, we must <em>capture</em> the requirements, not make a system that satisfies the requirements. This requires a change in mindset.

<li><p>If proving is cheap, prove it instead of testing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Amount of testing should be proportional to risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we make code testable?
<ul>
<li>Minimize its dependencies.</li>
<li>Minimize the number of things that you must set up before you can run it.</li>
<li>Why?
<ul>
<li>If you don't satisfy all its dependencies, you can't run it.</li>
<li>If you can't run it, you can't test it.</li>
<li>If your business logic depends on the database, you'll have to set up a database to test your business logic.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do we need to test?
<ul>
<li>Testing is proportional to risk.
<ul>
<li>Riskier code should be tested more.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.&quot; (Warren Buffett)
<ul>
<li>Buffett said that for investing, but it also applies to programming.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If it's obvious, don't test it. (Getters, setters, and DAOs without fancy logic)</li>
<li>If you can prove it, don't test it.</li>

<li>Hardware is moved.</li>
<li>Software is <em>copied</em>, not moved.</li>
<li>When you sell hardware, you <em>transfer</em> ownership. The hardware doesn't multiple into two.</li>
<li>There are two models:

<li>SaaS (software as a service, a web application; you control the hardware that runs the software, but not the input and output of the process)</li>
<li>bundling software with restricted hardware (Apple iPhone)</li>

<li>Isn't it absurd to judge a crime by its potentiality not its actuality?</li>
<li>Process is software. Law is software.</li>
<li>The chemical process in a chemical plant is also software, but not everyone owns a chemical plant.

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-programmer-and-a-software-engineer"><span class="section_number">6.4</span><span class="section_title">What is the difference between a programmer and a software engineer?</span></h3>
<p>The difference is in the amount of complexity that they can handle, the amount of foresight they make.</p>
<p>A programmer does not have to be backed by science. An engineer has to be backed by science.</p>
<p>It is the difference between bricklayer and an architect.</p>
<p>Commander and general.</p>
<p>Programming is tactical. Engineering is strategic.</p>
<p>A bricklayer can build a wall, or even a house, but not a skyscraper. A programmer can build a calculator, or a game, but not an operating system.</p>
<p>Bricklayer is less prestigious than architect, but they require a different skill set, and building requires both. Without the architect, the building would be shit. Without the bricklayer, the building would not exist at all in the first place.</p>
<p>Of course there are incompetent architects who build buildings despised by tenants, as there are incompetent software engineers who build software despised by users.</p>
<p>But software is much more complex than bridges and skyscrapers.</p>
<p>What is the science of software engineering? Classical physics is the science of civil engineering, and civil engineers understand physics well enough to predict everything they need to predict. If computer science is to be the science of software engineering, software engineers don't know computer science well enough to predict everything they need to predict. Worse, what if software is not predictable? What if the complexity is essential and irreducible?</p>
<p>Sometimes engineering front-runs science, and the engineer's ignorance harms lives. Coal mine explosions. Leaded gasoline. Microplastics. DDT. How can we predict what people will use new technology for? How can we predict the unintended consequences?</p>
<p>Engineers have to combat ignorant management decisions that harm people. Do you want to have blood on your hands?</p>
<p>Accidents happen. Buildings fall. Programs crash. People make mistakes, mostly honest.</p>
<p>When I get on an airplane, I want to get on one made by engineers, not business people. I want engineers to make the final decision.</p>
<p>If software is a pure art, then its construction should not be time-limited. A painter does not paint with deadlines. A painting is finished when the painter feels that it is finished. However, a painter, when asked to paint a very specific painting, can estimate how many days it will take.</p>
<p>How far can the civil-engineering analogy stretch before it breaks?</p>

<p>Programming is progressive relaxation of simplifying assumptions.</p>
<p>But has that activity already has another name: <em>modeling</em>.</p>
<p>We start with the assumption that the system does nothing.</p>
<p>Then we relax the assumption that all state is stored in memory.</p>
<p>Then we relax the assumption that errors do not happen.</p>
<p>Then we relax the assumption that the network latency is zero.</p>

<p>Coq source file extension is <code>.v</code>.</p>
<p>The notation <code>x:T</code> means &quot;the type of <code>x</code> is <code>T</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>x</code> inhabits <code>T</code>&quot;. It also means &quot;<code>x</code> is a proof of <code>T</code>&quot; by Curry-Howard isomorphism.</p>
<p>The type of <code>nat</code> is <code>Type(1)</code>.</p>
<p>The type of <code>set</code> is <code>Type(2)</code>.</p>
<p>The type of <code>Type(i)</code> is <code>Type(i+1)</code>.</p>

<h4 id="testing-1"><span class="section_number">7.1.6</span><span class="section_title">Testing</span></h4>
<p>Why do we test? Because we are not sure that our program is correct.</p>
<p>Why are we not sure that our program is correct?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because we don't know how to prove its correctness. This can be alleviated by using a decent programming language.</li>
<li>Because the cost of proving its correctness does not justify the benefit. We can't do anything about this if the complexity is essential (irreducible), not accidental.</li>
</ul>
<p>We human are fallible. Thus we will always test. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should we test?</li>
<li>How should we test?</li>
<li>What is the test that has the greatest benefit-to-cost ratio?</li>
</ul>
<p>The expected benefit of a test is the expected cost of the mistakes that might have been made if the test did not exist.</p>
<p>The quality of a test is the seriousness of the mistakes it prevents. Thus, the seriousness of testing is proportional to the seriousness of risk.</p>
<p>Test is insurance. A good insurance covers your risk. A bad insurance only wastes money and doesn't cover your risk: Testing Java class getters is like buying flood insurance for a house in the desert.</p>
<p>Insurance causes moral hazard (taking more risk because someone else pays for it). Does having a test cause you to take more risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>The benefit of a test is the cost of the mistakes it prevents.</li>
<li>The cost of a test is the person-hours spent writing the test and updating the test, and a slight increase in build time. (Assume $50/person-hour for simplicity.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions tell us what to test and how to test:</p>
<ul>
<li>What tests have the greatest benefit-to-cost ratio?</li>
<li>What mistakes do our tests prevent? How expensive are the mistakes that our tests prevent?</li>
<li>Which part of our code is most likely to cause expensive mistakes? (Example: testing getters won't prevent expensive mistakes.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code coverage is a meaningless metric. We should measure the expected value of mistakes instead. We should &quot;color&quot; our code: color more risky methods more red, color less risky methods more green, like this travel risk map<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> but for software.</p>
<p>If you are launching a rocket, then a mistake may cost billions of dollars. It makes sense to invest ten million dollars testing to avoid a 1/100 probability of making a billion-dollar mistake.</p>

<li>Programmers are too lazy to do the right thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Authentication systems such as OAuth are too complex for programmers to use or understand. Anything more than HTTP Basic Auth is too complex. It sucks to write code for handling authentication. How do we make a programming system such that handling authentication is not hard? What is authentication and authorization?</p>

<h3 id="how-should-we-build-software-especially-big-software"><span class="section_number">8.1</span><span class="section_title">How should we build software, especially big software?</span></h3>
<p>For big enterprise software, we should at least use model-driven engineering.</p>
<p>For a throw-away shell script, just open a text editor and be done with it.</p>
<p>For critical software, perhaps formal methods?</p>
<p>Brooks &amp; Kugler 1987 <span class="citation" data-cites="brooks1987no">[<a href="#ref-brooks1987no">2</a>]</span> have warned us about the essential irreducible complexity of software. Dijkstra 1972 <span class="citation" data-cites="dijkstra1972humble">[<a href="#ref-dijkstra1972humble">4</a>]</span> has warned us to control complexity with meaningful abstractions. We must understand what we do, and do what we understand. Model-driven engineering should be able to minimize the accidental complexity. The essential complexity of a software system is the minimum information required by software engineers to make the system. For example, &quot;an online shop&quot; is insufficient information: There are too many possibilities. What are we going to sell? How much traffic do we expect? What about the operations?</p>
<p>Some software is so big that we cannot finish it in two weeks. But in two weeks we are already a different person. Thus we should think of ourselves as <em>three</em> people: our past self, our present self, and our future self. How can these three people cooperate? If we keep feeling that our past self is stupid, if we don't trust the decision made by our past self, how can we progress at all, how can we build on something, how can we grow something? Our two-week-ago self did think that it was the best decision. If we cannot respect our past decisions, we are condemned to eternal refactoring. Software engineering, self-trust, self-peace?</p>
<p>The relationship between programming and past self?</p>
<p>The key to being a good programmer is being someone that our future self can trust.</p>
<p>When we change a program, we are trusting our past self. We assume that our past self did not plant time-bombs that will surprise our current assumptions.</p>
<p>I think software development can be sped up by minimizing the gap between the end-user's mental model and the programmer's mental model. Matching mental model is a requirement of good user experience.</p>
<h3 id="why-people-dont-adopt-metaprogramming-tools-and-model-driven-engineering"><span class="section_number">8.2</span><span class="section_title">Why people don't adopt metaprogramming tools (and model-driven engineering?)</span></h3>
<p>I fear that the tool doesn't perfectly fit my use case. When that happens, I want to drop down to the lower layer. Generated code is usually inflexible. I could maintain a patch, but isn't it (patching generated code) rather hacky and brittle? The right way is to design the metalanguage so that it can express such transformation.</p>

<h3 id="how-should-we-specialize-programmers"><span class="section_number">8.3</span><span class="section_title">How should we specialize programmers?</span></h3>
<p>In 2019 it is common to divide programmers into frontend programmers and backend programmers. I think this is wrong. It is like slicing a cake into layers instead of sectors: One person eats all the topping, another one the butter, another one eats the flour. However, if we talk about <em>making</em> instead of eating a cake, then it makes sense to specialize the chefs into topping specialists and dough specialists. Thus, is software engineering more like eating cakes or making cakes?</p>
<p>We should divide programmers into <em>business programmer</em> and <em>language programmer</em> instead. The language programmer creates a DSL (domain-specific language). The business programmer captures user requirements into a program (a specification) in that DSL. The language programmer writes a metaprogram that translates the business programmer's declarative program into something efficient.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-make-reliable-software"><span class="section_number">8.4</span><span class="section_title">How do we make reliable software?</span></h3>
<p>Make restarts cheap, quick, and easy, like in Erlang.</p>
<p>Reliability is not about the uptime of a single operating system process. Reliability is about the uptime of the whole system.</p>
<p>There are two attitudes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strive to write one fool-proof program that does not leak resources. This may be possible for operating systems, but is too hard for user applications? Let the OS handle the corner cases?</li>
<li>Use another system component's strengths to compensate for the program's weakness. Avoid stupid leaks, but do not strive to completely preclude resource leaks in corner cases. Make restart cheap and fast, and restart the program often. If the program is a web server, put it behind a load balancer, and rotate several instances often. This is more sane, efficient, and effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example insanity that arises from writing code that tries to be too smart: What to do if POSIX close fails?<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Corner cases exist in the first place due to bad design, unclear semantics, lack of foresight.</p>
<p>Robustness can be attained by a combination of fail-fast and restart-fast.</p>
<h3 id="the-context-of-premature-optimization"><span class="section_number">8.5</span><span class="section_title">The context of &quot;Premature optimization&quot;</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization</a></p>
<p>Knuth was telling us to focus on what matters.</p>
<p>The catchy maxim &quot;premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot; is at risk of being taken out of context.</p>
<p>(Straw-man) example where &quot;optimizing&quot; is stupid: You're building a small to-do list app, and you do it in C, and you use GOTO statements.</p>
<p>Example where not &quot;optimizing&quot; is stupid: You're building a electronic fuel injection system, and you don't know anything about jitter, latency, and real-time systems. Controlling latency here is a requirement, not an optimization.</p>

<p>When you hire a man, you can't just get his good side: you get both his good side and his bad side. When you hire a fast coder who is also a drunkard, a gambler, and a thief, you get not only the fast coder, but also the drunkard, the gambler, and the thief. You get all aspects of him.</p>
<p>It's the same with Android phones and telecommunication companies. Android phones are bundled with unwanted Google shit. Telkomsel Internet plans are bundled with unwanted movie quota shit. Why don't they have a no-bullshit pure-Internet plan?</p>

<p>Instead of these job titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>software engineer</li>
<li>data scientist</li>
<li>accountant</li>
</ul>
<p>How about these roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>the person who engineers software</li>
<li>the person who, scientifically, formulates experiments and answers questions</li>
<li>the person who keeps track of everything money-related</li>
</ul>
<p>And there is no 1:1 mapping from person to roles, unlike 1:1 mapping from person to job titles.</p>
<p>The compensation is based on roles. If you want more money, take more roles, probably inventing your own roles.</p>
<p>That is, we replace the question &quot;What are you&quot; with &quot;What do you do&quot;.</p>
<p>But job &quot;titles&quot; become long. &quot;I am a software engineer&quot; vs &quot;I engineer software&quot; vs &quot;I design, implement, and maintain software&quot;.</p>

<p>The question is &quot;Why are we hiring this person?&quot;</p>
<p>What problem are we trying to solve by hiring this person?</p>
<p>We are not solving problems; we are <em>trading</em> bigger problems with smaller problems. Hiring people solves some problems and creates new problems. But isn't that also true for everything we do? Every solution solves a problem and creates new problems. Thus the question is: Which problems would we rather handle?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-software-maintenance"><span class="section_number">10.1</span><span class="section_title">What is software maintenance?</span></h3>
<p>Software does not break down like machines. It is the things around the software that change. Hardware changes. Laws change. People change. The world changes. What was true when the software was made is no longer true.</p>
<p>But why do we change? Other animals have been living just fine for millions of years without much change. We change for fun, to avoid boredom.</p>
<p>It is fun to change things. It is less fun to be affected by changes.</p>
<p>The key to maintainable software is to depend only on dependable things. If A depend on B, then B should be more stable than A. If a program uses a library, then the library should be more stable than the program. If a library uses an operating system, then the operating system should be more stable than the library.</p>
<p>Stable dependencies principle<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>?</p>
<p>How to write a program that does not change? It must capture the timeless essence of reality. A bachelor is unmarried by definition, and that definition is unlikely to change.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-software-change"><span class="section_number">10.2</span><span class="section_title">Why does software change?</span></h3>
<p>A software system, once written, works forever: It will forever satisfy its specification.</p>
<p>The necessity of change originates outside the software system itself.</p>
<p>Examples of causes of change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes in tax laws</li>
<li>growing number of users</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-architecture-and-maintainability"><span class="section_number">10.3</span><span class="section_title">What is architecture and maintainability?</span></h3>
<p>Architecture is the set of things that are hard to change. (Who said this?)</p>
<p>A system is <em>maintainable</em> iff likely changes are easy.</p>
<p>A system is <em>maintainable</em> iff the difficulty of a change is proportional to the likelihood of that change.</p>
<p>A system is <em>maintainable</em> iff the change in implementation is proportional to the change in specification. Thus, in such system, every small change in specification translates to small change in implementation.</p>
<p>Maintainability is about foreseeing what changes will be likely. Maintainability, like security, cannot be an afterthought. They must be designed from the beginning.</p>
<p>To maximize maintainability, we must code at a level of abstraction as close as possible to the specification.</p>
<p>Must be weighed probabilistically. It is unlikely that we will ever want to change an accounting system to a city-building game.</p>
<p>Example of architectural change: Adding undo capability to a software system that was not designed with undo in mind. Adding undo requires reification of all undoable actions.</p>
<h3 id="backward-compatibility-complicates-development-but-simplifies-maintenance"><span class="section_number">10.4</span><span class="section_title">Backward-compatibility complicates development but simplifies maintenance</span></h3>
<p>Reasons for maintaining backward-compatibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you maintain your library's backward-compatibility, you only need to maintain the latest version of the library.</li>
<li>Compatibility reduces dependency hell and bit rot.</li>
<li>The root cause of dependency hell / DLL hell / JAR hell is short-sighted incompetent library developers who don't care about compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons for breaking backward-compatibility?</p>
<ul>
<li>Backward-compatibility hampers changing the interface (including fixing interface mistakes). But you can always introduce a new interface and deprecate the old one. But you will then collect junk.</li>

<p>An interface is something that users depend on.</p>
<p>Your library's interface is what breaks your users' code if that interface changes.</p>
<p>Examples of interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function parameters.</li>
<li>Performance. Example: Replacing an algorithm with a slower one may stop your users from satisfying their non-functional requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>A backward-compatible change is a change that doesn't annoy the people who depend on you. Such change doesn't require those people to react. Such change doesn't break those people's works.</p>

<p>Nature is objective, cold, and consistent. The laws of nature is practically unchanging.</p>
<p>Nature does not care. If you make wrong calculations, your structure is going to fall and kill people.</p>
<p>When a politician lies, he wins, because he is lying to humans. When an engineer lies, he loses, because Nature does not care about our beliefs.</p>
<p>Nature does not respect beliefs.</p>
<p>It is easier to tell the truth than to lie. To lie, one has to think hard to perpetuate the lie. But politicians don't even lie; they don't even bother trying to make their lies consistent. To them, words incite emotion, not convey information.</p>

            Disqus has been removed because it hijacks my links and redirects them to third-party ad networks.
            On 2019-05-27, a friend of mine reported that links on my website are broken,
            and I caught Disqus red-handed redirecting my links to pwieu.com.
