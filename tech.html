<h2 id="how-do-we-liberate-people-with-technology"><span class="section_number">1</span><span class="section_title">How do we liberate people with technology?</span></h2>
<p>I am looking for a technology that empowers people and liberates people, a technology that makes power centralization impractical. I thought I could change the world with politics, but now I think politics only wastes time, and now I think technology is the only hope for making something in the physical-law layer to bypass the convoluted human-made-law layer. I think law should be principle-based, and justice should be restorative. I think the world needs only one law: Try not to harm others. Nobody bothers to fix the broken political systems. Nobody even bothers to think. Political systems are too expensive to fix; it is much cheaper to scrap them.</p>
<p>The system must assume the worst of humans: they are lazy, greedy, stupid, clever at gaming the system, willing to cheat, and short-sighted (bad at thinking about long chains of causes and long-term causes).</p>
<p>What do we mean by &quot;physically undefeatable&quot;? We mean this. For example, government officials are not going to nuke 7 billion disobedient people, because they would kill themselves if they did that. For example, no legislator can make properly-used one-time pads breakable, because such breaking is a mathematical/physical impossibility. Human law is not the supreme law. Natural law is the supreme law.</p>
<p>Which is more practical: crypto-anarchy, or inventing a biological agent that enables us to control other humans?</p>
<p>We prefer peaceful means. We dislike revolutions. We don't want to be in a revolution. We want to convince people by reason, not by force.</p>
<h2 id="what"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">What?</span></h2>
<p>I <a href="usecom.html">use computers</a>. I <a href="phone.html">buy a smartphone</a> when my old smartphone becomes unusable. I usually watch YouTube at 2x-3x speed; we can speed it up to 16x<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We don't do drugs. We need the full capacity of our minds. Drugs would impair us.</p>
<p>We aim to peacefully, rationally, technologically, and undefeatably actualize an anarchy where no person has too much power over others. We dream of precluding power centralization, or, at least, preventing or impeding it, in a physical way such that natural laws go against human-made laws. We research science and technology, mostly physics, cryptography, and distributed computing, but only insofar as they concern techno-anarchy.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-users-use-distributed-systems"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">Why don't users use distributed systems?</span></h2>
<p>Users don't care; they want software to just work.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I find YaCy<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> unusable: its search result relevance is too far behind Google. YaCy-related things<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> seem to also suffer from usability issues.</p>
<p>We should make a &quot;freedom pack&quot;: an installer of essential free/libre open-source distributed-web applications. The pack might contain things like matrix.org, riot.im. But why stop there? Why not make free/libre distributed operating system<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> with all those goodies preinstalled?</p>

<h2 id="what-are-whatsapp-alternative"><span class="section_number">4</span><span class="section_title">What are WhatsApp alternative?</span></h2>
<p>&lt;2019-01-31&gt; Facebook is merging WhatsApp? We need an alternative with better privacy?</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-increase-homemadeability"><span class="section_number">5</span><span class="section_title">How do we increase homemadeability?</span></h2>
<p>Why do we want homemadeability? Because homemadeability promotes equality, liberty, and anarchism. <em>Everything</em> should be homemadeable, including nuclear bombs. Only when everyone can produce everything will we have equality and liberty.</p>
<p>Why is not everything homemadeable?</p>
<p>Does it make sense to use solar power (1000 W/m2) for nuclear transmutation?</p>
<pre class="example"><code>E = mc2
9e16 J = 1 kg
1 J = 1.11e-17 kg
</code></pre>
<p>No.</p>
<p>How do we make nuclear transmutation homemadeable? What prevents energy from turning into matter? What prevents matter from turning into energy? What prevents matter from breaking down? Why is matter stable? What is matter? What is energy? A mathematical quantity?</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-farm-in-cities"><span class="section_number">6</span><span class="section_title">How should we farm in cities?</span></h2>
<p>I thought about <a href="subsist.html">starting a farm in the middle of Jakarta</a>, but I put it on hold because I felt that the opportunity cost was too high.</p>
<p>The key to farming is to understand ecology, some botany (plant physiology and pathology), and nutrient cycle.</p>
<p>We should care more about phosphate run-off. Phosphates are vital and non-renewable, like fossil fuel. The bad news is that there is no cycle bringing back the phosphates from the sea to the land, unlike water with its hydrologic cycle.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-bitcoin-not-work"><span class="section_number">8</span><span class="section_title">Why does Bitcoin not work?</span></h2>
<p>It's too slow.</p>
<p>It uses too much energy.</p>
<p>Satoshi assumes that the users are ideal anarchists. Alas, the actual users are mostly mindless greedy humans who want to get money without working.</p>
<h2 id="technology-that-liberates"><span class="section_number">9</span><span class="section_title">Technology that liberates</span></h2>
<p>Our goal is to create a technology that:</p>
<ul>
<li>distributes power to the people,</li>
<li>keeps it distributed; prevents centralization</li>
</ul>
<p>We need these technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>a system that unrestrictably disseminates information</li>
<li>a single global digital food-backed currency ($1 means the right to one meal)</li>
<li>distributed electricity generation</li>
<li>distributed web browser, hosting, and operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical laws is our only chance of defeating man-made laws.</p>
<p>Prosecutability/enforceability is more important than legality. Being illegal does not always imply being prosecutable. If nobody reports, the police has no case. If there are too many criminals, the police can't do much.</p>
<p>Principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should not reap what you don't sow. Your wealth should be proportional to your contribution to society. You should not be entitled what you don't earn. If you don't work, you should not be paid. Abolish inheritance.</li>

<p>You should not be liable for what is not your fault. If you are born disabled, it's not your fault.</p>
<p>But how can you work if you are disabled?</p>
<h4 id="technology-for-anarchy"><span class="section_number">9.1.2</span><span class="section_title">Technology for anarchy?</span></h4>
<p>How do you host something without being liable for it? For example, someone uploads porn to your distributed network.</p>
<p>Encryption-at-rest, and in transit, with tamper-resistant private key that self-destructs readily?</p>
<p>Even simpler. Split the file into several parts, and host each part in different host. Sorites paradox. At how many bytes does a file contain porn? If everyone is a criminal, then nobody is a criminal.</p>
<p>Currency tied to food price. A meal should be nutritious and nourishing and healthy. $1 = 1 meal. Labor that enables the meal. $1 = cooking 5 meals. The cook creates a value of $5 but gets paid only $1. Let everything be market. $? = Creating a technology that enables us to make more meals. $1 = protection for 8 hours. How should we value art, programming, etc.? Let the market decide! How does software enable us to create more meals?</p>
<p>If everyone takes more value than they create, the system collapses.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting is not a solution. It's still centralized. Your cloud provider decides what to host. Government can crack cloud providers down.</p>

<p>It is illegal to sell cocaine, but is it illegal to sell cocaine-making machine and cocaine precursors? It should be as legal as selling frying pan and salt! A knife can harm people, but is it not illegal to sell a knife! Drugs shouldn't be illegal in the first place!</p>

Everyone issues his own banknotes, like banks before Federal Reserve existed. I issue a note &quot;I owe John 5 meals&quot;. Everyone issues his own notes, and let the market exchange works it out. A note is a certificate of debt. X did something for Y. Y did something for Z. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency</a> Free banking Private digital fiat complementary currency Trusted third party guarantees notes? A guarantor ensures that private notes are convertible to meals, for example by ensuring convertibility to USD. A guarantor is responsible for checking that the issuer has the assets to back the issued notes, because a note is a certificate of debt. A guarantor should personally know the issuer. A guarantor limits the amount of currency an issuer can issue. Credit US dollar: If I give you C$1, it means I owe you $1.</p>
<p>Food sellers issue their own currencies. For example, I can produce 100 meals, and I sell each meal for $1.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-name"><span class="section_number">11.2</span><span class="section_title">What is a name?</span></h3>
<p>A name is a reference.</p>
<p>&quot;John&quot; refers to that blob of matter over there?</p>

<h3 id="how-do-humans-name-humans"><span class="section_number">11.3</span><span class="section_title">How do humans name humans?</span></h3>
<p>If many people with the exact same name are in the same group, then they decide their <em>local names</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine that there are 5 people named the exact same &quot;John Smith&quot; in the same group. There must be differences: one may have white hair, one may be fat, one may be tall, etc. They may name themselves &quot;John White&quot;, &quot;White John&quot;, &quot;Fat John&quot; or &quot;John Smith the Fat&quot; or &quot;John 'Fat' Smith&quot;, &quot;Tall John&quot;, &quot;Texas John&quot;, &quot;Old John&quot;, &quot;Wise John&quot;, &quot;Mark&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>&quot;John&quot; means &quot;Jehovah has favored&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. &quot;Matthew&quot; means &quot;gift of Jehovah&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Sitting Bull&quot; is English translation of his native Lakota name<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. &quot;Mississippi&quot; means &quot;big river&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. &quot;Ontario&quot; means &quot;beautiful lake&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Names do not have to be meaningful. For example, in principle, nothing prevents a father from regrettably naming his child &quot;Tralala&quot; or &quot;Hmph&quot;.</p>
