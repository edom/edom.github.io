<p>Around 2019-11-08, I was reading much literature about remote viewing, and I found many resources with various agenda, from the most legitimate open-minded people to the most illegitimate crackpots. My motivation for learning quantum mechanics was to distinguish between legitimate hypotheses and quantum woo.</p>
<p>But all the crackpots I have encountered are so obvious that one immediately suspects crackpottery even without any knowledge of quantum mechanics. Perhaps it is their very attempt at looking legitimate that gives them away.</p>
<p>But to me there is no practical difference between legitimate advanced hypotheses and illegitimate crackpots; both are incomprehensible and useless to me, and I shall treat them equally: give them the benefit of the doubt, and ignore them until I understand them, if ever.</p>
<h2 id="to-understand-is-to-model-accurately"><span class="section_number">2</span><span class="section_title">To understand is to model accurately</span></h2>
<p>To understand something is to create a reasonably accurate model (internal mental model) of it.</p>
<p>I want to write a physics book with emphasis in <em>modeling</em>, because that is what physics is.</p>
<h2 id="physics-and-mathematics"><span class="section_number">3</span><span class="section_title">Physics and mathematics</span></h2>
<p>Physics is about understanding (and therefore creating a reasonably accurate model of) reality, and mathematics is its tool for concise precise communication.</p>

<h3 id="modeling-spacetime-as-euclidean-space"><span class="section_number">5.1</span><span class="section_title">Modeling spacetime as Euclidean space</span></h3>
<p>Here we consider the classical model of spacetime.</p>
<p>Space is represented by a three-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
<p>Time is represented by a one-dimensional Euclidean space, isomorphic to the real line, the set of real numbers. (Thus we sometimes say &quot;a point in time&quot;).</p>
<p>An <em>Euclidean space</em> is a set of points.</p>
<p>An <em>Euclidean vector space</em> is a set of vectors with Euclidean metric.</p>
<p>The number of dimensions of an Euclidean space is the maximum number of mutually orthogonal lines you can simultaneously make without making any pair of them parallel. For example, if we pick three pens, we can arrange them into three vectors which are orthogonal to each other. But, if we pick four pens, we know no way to arrange them as four mutually orthogonal vectors. That is why we think that space is three-dimensional.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-motion-as-function"><span class="section_number">5.2</span><span class="section_title">Modeling motion as function</span></h3>
<p>An <em>observer</em> is chosen at an arbitrary point O in space.</p>
<p>An arbitrary point in time is chosen, and is designated as the <em>zero time</em>.</p>
<p>Addition behaves as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vector + Vector = Vector: The addition of a vector AB and a vector BC produces a vector AB + BC = AC.</li>
<li>Point + Vector = Point: The addition of a point X and a vector XY produces the point X + XY = Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>position</em> of an object at position B <em>as observed by an observer</em> at position A is represented by the <em>vector</em> AB.</p>
<p>The <em>motion</em> of an object of interest <em>as observed by an observer</em> at position O is represented by a function <span class="math inline">\( x \)</span> whose interpretation is: &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the object of interest is at position <span class="math inline">\(O + x(t)\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>In short, a <em>movement</em> is a change in position, and a <em>motion</em> is a continuous movement.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-instantaneous-velocity-with-derivatives"><span class="section_number">5.3</span><span class="section_title">Modeling instantaneous velocity with derivatives</span></h3>
<p>If we record that a body was at position <span class="math inline">\(x(t_0)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and that it was at position <span class="math inline">\(x(t_1)\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, then we say that the body moved between time <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> with the <em>average velocity</em> <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v}(t_0,t_1) = \frac{x(t_1)-x(t_0)}{t_1-t_0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we endeavor to record the movement more frequently that <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, we approximate the <em>instantaneous velocity</em> of the body at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\( v(t_0) = \lim_{t_1 \to t_0} v(t_0,t_1) = \lim_{t_1 \to t_0} \frac{x(t_1) - x(t_0)}{t_1 - t_0} \)</span>.</p>
<p>We define &quot;the <em>derivative</em> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>&quot; as <span class="math inline">\( [Df](x) \)</span> where:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
[Df](x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{align*}
\]</span>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(Df\)</span> notates a function, read &quot;derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>&quot;, not &quot;<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\([Df](x)\)</span> notates the output produced by function <span class="math inline">\(Df\)</span> for input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The concept of derivative is required for Newton's model of a many-body system.</p>
<p>Exercise: If <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span>, evaluate <span class="math inline">\([Df](5)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="euclidean-spaces-vs-real-tuple-spaces"><span class="section_number">5.4</span><span class="section_title">Euclidean spaces vs real tuple spaces</span></h3>
<p>Euclidean spaces and real tuple spaces are isomorphic, but they are not the same. An Euclidean space is a set of points. A real tuple space is a set of tuples of real numbers.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-motion-in-newtonian-kinematics"><span class="section_number">5.5</span><span class="section_title">Modeling motion in Newtonian kinematics</span></h3>
<p>The position of a body at a given time is represented by a vector in the observer's vector space.</p>
<h3 id="modeling-motion-in-lagrangian-kinematics"><span class="section_number">5.6</span><span class="section_title">Modeling motion in Lagrangian kinematics?</span></h3>
<p>Let O be the fixed point of the pendulum, that is, the point where the rope is fixed to the frame/stand/fixture.</p>
<p>For example, instead of representing the position of a pendulum bob by three real numbers <span class="math inline">\((x,y,z)\)</span> relative to the point O, one may choose to represent the position of that pendulum bob by one real number <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that represents the angle from the normal line (a line that is perpendicular to the floor and passes the point O).</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with Newtonian mechanics, and you want to understand analytical mechanics, perhaps read <span class="citation" data-cites="lanczos2012variational">[<a href="#ref-lanczos2012variational">1</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Lagrangian mechanics exploits the conservation of energy to simplify the mathematical description of a dynamical system?</p>
<h3 id="modeling-transverse-waves-or-surface-waves"><span class="section_number">5.7</span><span class="section_title">Modeling transverse waves or surface waves</span></h3>
<p>A wave is represented by a function</p>
<p>f : Position × Time → Amplitude</p>
<p>The interpretation is: &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the amplitude of the part of the wave at point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(f(x,t)\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Amplitude is displacement from resting position.</p>
<p>That is, a wave is often represented as an <em>amplitude field</em>. (In mathematical physics, an &quot;X field&quot; is a function from position to X.)</p>
<p>Example phenomena that can be represented by periodic functions: the motion of a pendulum, the surface waves of water in a pond, the oscillation of a guitar string.</p>
<p>Often, the wave is extrapolated to infinity. For example, when modeling a pond, we often assume that the pond is infinite, it has no edges, and waves do not reflect off the edges. We assume that wave propagate freely without hitting any obstacles, without reflection, without diffraction.</p>
<p>If we use the simplifying assumption that a wave repeats infinitely in both space and time, then we can define wavelength and period:</p>
<p>A wave has <em>wavelength</em> <span class="math inline">\( |dx| \)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\( dx \)</span> is a shortest vector (the shortest vector) such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x+dx,t) = f(x,t)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span>.</p>
<p>A wave has <em>period</em> <span class="math inline">\( dt \)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\( dt \)</span> is the smallest positive number such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x,t+dt) = f(x,t)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\( x \)</span>.</p>
<p>That is, wavelength is spatial periodicity, and period is temporal periodicity.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-justification-for-the-principle-of-stationary-action"><span class="section_number">6</span><span class="section_title">What is the justification for the principle of stationary action?</span></h2>
<p>An example of a variational principle is Fermat's principle: the path taken by light in free space is such that the time of travel is minimized.</p>
<p>Another example: If an object moves from <span class="math inline">\((x_0,t_0)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((x_1,t_1)\)</span> in a conservative force field, then the motion (the path) is such that energy (the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy) is conserved, that is, the force does zero work on the object at every point of the object's actual trajectory in spacetime.</p>
<p>Given a hypothetical path, we can compute the work the force <em>would</em> do to the object if the object followed that path.</p>

<p>A force is defined as the cause of motion.</p>
<p>If we observe that an object is accelerating, then we take it to mean that a non-zero resultant force is acting on the object.</p>
<p>Newton's second law: Iff <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is the sum of all forces acting on an object at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and iff <span class="math inline">\( p(t) \)</span> is the object's momentum at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\( F = Dp \)</span>.</p>

<p>Consider a system that consists of several tiny bodies in motion.</p>
<p>Newton, Lagrange, Hamilton, Schrödinger, and Einstein are about modeling the evolution of a many-body system. It is about identifying tacit simplifying assumptions and relaxing them. Relaxing a tacit simplifying assumption produces a theory that is more complex but more accurate.</p>

<h3 id="newton-model-of-a-many-body-system"><span class="section_number">9.1</span><span class="section_title">Newton model of a many-body system</span></h3>
<p>The interpretation is: &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span>, the position of body <span class="math inline">\( k \)</span> is <span class="math inline">\( x_k(t) \)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>For each body <span class="math inline">\( k \)</span>, its trajectory is represented by a function <span class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span> : Time → Position, where time is represented by a real number, and a body's position is represented by a point in a three-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
<p>Iff <span class="math inline">\( x(t) \)</span> is an object's position at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\( p(t) \)</span> is the object's momentum at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and iff the object's mass is constant <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\( p(t) = m \cdot [D x](t) \)</span>, or, <span class="math inline">\( p = m \cdot D x \)</span>, but note that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is a scalar and <span class="math inline">\(Dx\)</span> is a function (which is a vector in a function space, in the generalized mathematical sense), and thus <span class="math inline">\(m \cdot Dx\)</span> can be thought of as &quot;<span class="math inline">\(Dx\)</span> scaled by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\( F_k(t) \)</span> is the sum of forces acting on object <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Because acceleration is the second time-derivative of position, we can substitute <span class="math inline">\( a_k = D(Dx_k) \)</span> into <span class="math inline">\( F_k = m_k \cdot a_k \)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\( F_k = m_k \cdot D(Dx_k) \)</span>.</p>
<p>If the bodies are celestial objects, then the shape of <span class="math inline">\( F_k \)</span> is determined by Newton's law of universal gravitation.</p>
<p>Thus, in the Newton model, the entire system of <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> bodies is represented by <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> differential equations, in which each differential equation has the shape <span class="math inline">\( F_k(t) = m_k \cdot [D(Dx)](t) \)</span>, where the expression <span class="math inline">\( F_k \)</span> usually contains <span class="math inline">\( x_k \)</span>.</p>
<p>One should not confuse a function and its expression.</p>
<h3 id="lagrange-model-of-a-many-body-system"><span class="section_number">9.2</span><span class="section_title">Lagrange model of a many-body system</span></h3>
<p>You may want to read Lagrange's own words (albeit translated from French into English)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, from page 169. It has historical context. It may also describe Lagrange's train of thought. It can be downloaded as PDF.</p>
<p>If the Newton model of an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-body system consists of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> differential equations, the Lagrange model of the same system consists of <em>one</em> equation?</p>
<p>The interpretation is &quot;At time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the position of body <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(x_k(q_k(t),t)\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\( x_k \)</span> : GenCoord-k × Time → Position</p>
<p>Each GenCoord-k is a real tuple space and may have a dimension different from other GenCoord-i spaces.</p>

<p>In the wave-mechanics model, the position of a body is represented by a parameter of the system's wave function.</p>
<p>In the wave-mechanics model, the entire system of <span class="math inline">\( n \)</span> bodies is represented by a function Position-1 × … × Position-n × Time → Complex.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\( \psi(x_1, \ldots, x_n, t) \)</span>.</p>
<p>Key question: What do the parameters of <span class="math inline">\( \psi \)</span> represent?</p>
<p>In the Schrödinger–Born model, the real number <span class="math inline">\( |\psi(x_1,\ldots,x_n,t)|^2 \)</span> represents the density of the probability of finding, at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, that body 1 is at <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, …, and body <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is at <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span>. That is, the positions of the bodies are not as separate as in the Newton model.</p>

<p>However, people fiercely disagree about the meaning of the wave function.</p>
<h3 id="einstein-model-of-a-many-body-system"><span class="section_number">9.5</span><span class="section_title">Einstein model of a many-body system</span></h3>
<p>All the above models of mechanics, both classical and quantum, make tacit assumptions about spacetime (space and time). In particular, they presume that spacetime is absolute and the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Einstein models replaces the assumption of absolute spacetime (shared by all bodies) with relative (body-specific) spacetime.</p>
<p>(Here I am using &quot;body&quot; as a synonym of &quot;observer&quot;.)</p>
<p>In Einstein models, there is no such thing as &quot;the position of body <span class="math inline">\( k \)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span>&quot;; it is replaced with &quot;the position of body <span class="math inline">\( j \)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\( t \)</span> <em>according to body <span class="math inline">\( i \)</span></em>&quot;, that is, <em>both</em> the position and the time are as seen from body <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here we write <span class="math inline">\([i:x_j(t)]\)</span> to mean &quot;the position of body <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> according to body <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>&quot;.</p>
<p>Newton models tacitly assume <span class="math inline">\([i:x_j(t)] = -[j:x_i(t)]\)</span>.</p>
<p>What does &quot;simultaneous&quot; (&quot;at the same time&quot;) mean in this model?</p>
<p>How do we know if two things are simultaneous?</p>
<p>Einstein postulated the constancy of the speed of light in order to make Maxwell's equations to have the same form in all reference frames.</p>
<p>In special relativity, each body has its own time.</p>
<p>A body's time is defined operationally as whatever is measured by a clock attached to the body.</p>
<p>How do we describe curvature?<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>(Notes to functional programmers: Types can help elucidate Einstein's field equations.)</p>
<p>At the lowest layer, there are only numbers; vectors, matrices, and tensors can be thought of as a meaningful way of grouping numbers.</p>
<h3 id="the-next-model"><span class="section_number">9.6</span><span class="section_title">The next model?</span></h3>
<p>A common problem with <em>all</em> those model is that they tacitly assume that spacetime is infinitely divisible like the set of real numbers.</p>
<p>But what would be the mathematics of non-continuous spaces be like? And what would it imply about the isotropy of space?</p>
